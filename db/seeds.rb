It omits the final \"no-endorsement\" clause and is thus roughly equivalent to the MIT License.\r\n\r\nHistorical Background: The original license used on BSD Unix had four clauses.

  {name: "gplv2", description: "GNU General Public License, version 2.0", version: "2.0", category_id: 1, license_type_id: 3, flag_osi: true, text_license: "The GNU General Public License (GPL-2.0)\r\nVersion 2, June 1991\r\nCopyright (C) 1989, 1991 Free Software Foundation, Inc.\r\n59 Temple Place, Suite 330, Boston, MA 02111-1307 USA\r\n\r\nEveryone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies\r\nof this license document, but changing it is not allowed.\r\n\r\nPreamble\r\n\r\nThe licenses for most software are designed to take away your freedom to share and change it. By contrast, the GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free software--to make sure the software is free for all its users. This General Public License applies to most of the Free Software Foundation's software and to any other program whose authors commit to using it. (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered by the GNU Library General Public License instead.) You can apply it to your programs, too.\r\n\r\nWhen we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price. Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.\r\n\r\nTo protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights. These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.\r\n\r\nFor example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that you have. You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code. And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.\r\n\r\nWe protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and (2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the software.\r\n\r\nAlso, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free software. If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original authors' reputations.\r\n\r\nFinally, any free program is threatened constantly by software patents. We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free program will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the program proprietary. To prevent this, we have made it clear that any patent must be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.\r\n\r\nThe precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modification follow.\r\n\r\nTERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION\r\n\r\n0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed under the terms of this General Public License. The \"Program\", below, refers to any such program or work, and a \"work based on the Program\" means either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another language. (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in the term \"modification\".) Each licensee is addressed as \"you\".\r\n\r\nActivities other than copying, distribution and modification are not covered by this License; they are outside its scope. The act of running the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the Program (independent of having been made by running the Program). Whether that is true depends on what the Program does.\r\n\r\n1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty; and give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License along with the Program.\r\n\r\nYou may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.\r\n\r\n2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion of it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1 above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:\r\n\r\na) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.\r\n\r\nb) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third parties under the terms of this License.\r\n\r\nc) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively when run, you must cause it, when started running for such interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this License. (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but does not normally print such an announcement, your work based on the Program is not required to print an announcement.)\r\n\r\nThese requirements apply to the modified work as a whole. If identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program, and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those sections when you distribute them as separate works. But when you distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based on the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.\r\n\r\nThus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or collective works based on the Program.\r\n\r\nIn addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under the scope of this License.\r\n\r\n3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:\r\n\r\na) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,\r\n\r\nb) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,\r\n\r\nc) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer to distribute corresponding source code. (This alternative is allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you received the program in object code or executable form with such an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)\r\n\r\nThe source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for making modifications to it. For an executable work, complete source code means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation and installation of the executable. However, as a special exception, the source code distributed need not include anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies the executable.\r\n\r\nIf distribution of executable or object code is made by offering access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the source code from the same place counts as distribution of the source code, even though third parties are not compelled to copy the source along with the object code.\r\n\r\n4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program except as expressly provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License. However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.\r\n\r\n5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not signed it. However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or distribute the Program or its derivative works. These actions are prohibited by law if you do not accept this License. Therefore, by modifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying the Program or works based on it.\r\n\r\n6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to these terms and conditions. You may not impose any further restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein. You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to this License.\r\n\r\n7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues), conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not excuse you from the conditions of this License. If you cannot distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may not distribute the Program at all. For example, if a patent license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to refrain entirely from distribution of the Program.\r\n\r\nIf any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.\r\n\r\nIt is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the integrity of the free software distribution system, which is implemented by public license practices. Many people have made generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed through that system in reliance on consistent application of that system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot impose that choice.\r\n\r\nThis section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to be a consequence of the rest of this License.\r\n\r\n8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the original copyright holder who places the Program under this License may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus excluded. In such case, this License incorporates the limitation as if written in the body of this License.\r\n\r\n9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of the General Public License from time to time. Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.\r\n\r\nEach version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Program specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and \"any later version\", you have the option of following the terms and conditions either of that version or of any later version published by the Free Software Foundation. If the Program does not specify a version number of this License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software Foundation.\r\n\r\n10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author to ask for permission. For software which is copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this. Our decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.\r\n\r\nNO WARRANTY\r\n\r\n11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM \"AS IS\" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.\r\n\r\n12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.\r\n\r\nEND OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\r\n\r\nHow to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs\r\n\r\nIf you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.\r\n\r\nTo do so, attach the following notices to the program. It is safest to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the \"copyright\" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.\r\n\r\nOne line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.\r\nCopyright (C) <year> <name of author>\r\n\r\nThis program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by the Free Software Foundation; either version 2 of the License, or (at your option) any later version.\r\n\r\nThis program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful, but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. See the GNU General Public License for more details.\r\n\r\nYou should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License along with this program; if not, write to the Free Software Foundation, Inc., 59 Temple Place, Suite 330, Boston, MA 02111-1307 USA\r\n\r\nAlso add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.\r\n\r\nIf the program is interactive, make it output a short notice like this when it starts in an interactive mode:\r\n\r\nGnomovision version 69, Copyright (C) year name of author Gnomovision comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w'. This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it under certain conditions; type `show c' for details.\r\n\r\nThe hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the appropriate parts of the General Public License. Of course, the commands you use may be called something other than `show w' and `show c'; they could even be mouse-clicks or menu items--whatever suits your program.\r\n\r\nYou should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your school, if any, to sign a \"copyright disclaimer\" for the program, if necessary. Here is a sample; alter the names:\r\n\r\nYoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the program `Gnomovision' (which makes passes at compilers) written by James Hacker.\r\n\r\nsignature of Ty Coon, 1 April 1989\r\nTy Coon, President of Vice\r\n\r\nThis General Public License does not permit incorporating your program into proprietary programs.

  {name: "gplv3", description: "GNU General Public License, version 3.0", version: "3.0", category_id: 1, license_type_id: 3, flag_osi: true, text_license: "GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE\r\nVersion 3, 29 June 2007\r\n\r\nCopyright (C) 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc. <http://fsf.org/>\r\n\r\nEveryone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.\r\n\r\nPreamble\r\nThe GNU General Public License is a free, copyleft license for software and other kinds of works.\r\n\r\nThe licenses for most software and other practical works are designed to take away your freedom to share and change the works. By contrast, the GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change all versions of a program--to make sure it remains free software for all its users. We, the Free Software Foundation, use the GNU General Public License for most of our software; it applies also to any other work released this way by its authors. You can apply it to your programs, too.\r\n\r\nWhen we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price. Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for them if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new free programs, and that you know you can do these things.\r\n\r\nTo protect your rights, we need to prevent others from denying you these rights or asking you to surrender the rights. Therefore, you have certain responsibilities if you distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it: responsibilities to respect the freedom of others.\r\n\r\nFor example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether gratis or for a fee, you must pass on to the recipients the same freedoms that you received. You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code. And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.\r\n\r\nDevelopers that use the GNU GPL protect your rights with two steps: (1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer you this License giving you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify it.\r\n\r\nFor the developers' and authors' protection, the GPL clearly explains that there is no warranty for this free software. For both users' and authors' sake, the GPL requires that modified versions be marked as changed, so that their problems will not be attributed erroneously to authors of previous versions.\r\n\r\nSome devices are designed to deny users access to install or run modified versions of the software inside them, although the manufacturer can do so. This is fundamentally incompatible with the aim of protecting users' freedom to change the software. The systematic pattern of such abuse occurs in the area of products for individuals to use, which is precisely where it is most unacceptable. Therefore, we have designed this version of the GPL to prohibit the practice for those products. If such problems arise substantially in other domains, we stand ready to extend this provision to those domains in future versions of the GPL, as needed to protect the freedom of users.\r\n\r\nFinally, every program is threatened constantly by software patents. States should not allow patents to restrict development and use of software on general-purpose computers, but in those that do, we wish to avoid the special danger that patents applied to a free program could make it effectively proprietary. To prevent this, the GPL assures that patents cannot be used to render the program non-free.\r\n\r\nThe precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modification follow.\r\n\r\nTERMS AND CONDITIONS\r\n0. Definitions.\r\n“This License” refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License.\r\n\r\n“Copyright” also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds of works, such as semiconductor masks.\r\n\r\n“The Program” refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this License. Each licensee is addressed as “you”. “Licensees” and “recipients” may be individuals or organizations.\r\n\r\nTo “modify” a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work in a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of an exact copy. The resulting work is called a “modified version” of the earlier work or a work “based on” the earlier work.\r\n\r\nA “covered work” means either the unmodified Program or a work based on the Program.\r\n\r\nTo “propagate” a work means to do anything with it that, without permission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for infringement under applicable copyright law, except executing it on a computer or modifying a private copy. Propagation includes copying, distribution (with or without modification), making available to the public, and in some countries other activities as well.\r\n\r\nTo “convey” a work means any kind of propagation that enables other parties to make or receive copies. Mere interaction with a user through a computer network, with no transfer of a copy, is not conveying.\r\n\r\nAn interactive user interface displays “Appropriate Legal Notices” to the extent that it includes a convenient and prominently visible feature that (1) displays an appropriate copyright notice, and (2) tells the user that there is no warranty for the work (except to the extent that warranties are provided), that licensees may convey the work under this License, and how to view a copy of this License. If the interface presents a list of user commands or options, such as a menu, a prominent item in the list meets this criterion.\r\n\r\n1. Source Code.\r\nThe “source code” for a work means the preferred form of the work for making modifications to it. “Object code” means any non-source form of a work.\r\n\r\nA “Standard Interface” means an interface that either is an official standard defined by a recognized standards body, or, in the case of interfaces specified for a particular programming language, one that is widely used among developers working in that language.\r\n\r\nThe “System Libraries” of an executable work include anything, other than the work as a whole, that (a) is included in the normal form of packaging a Major Component, but which is not part of that Major Component, and (b) serves only to enable use of the work with that Major Component, or to implement a Standard Interface for which an implementation is available to the public in source code form. A “Major Component”, in this context, means a major essential component (kernel, window system, and so on) of the specific operating system (if any) on which the executable work runs, or a compiler used to produce the work, or an object code interpreter used to run it.\r\n\r\nThe “Corresponding Source” for a work in object code form means all the source code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable work) run the object code and to modify the work, including scripts to control those activities. However, it does not include the work's System Libraries, or general-purpose tools or generally available free programs which are used unmodified in performing those activities but which are not part of the work. For example, Corresponding Source includes interface definition files associated with source files for the work, and the source code for shared libraries and dynamically linked subprograms that the work is specifically designed to require, such as by intimate data communication or control flow between those subprograms and other parts of the work.\r\n\r\nThe Corresponding Source need not include anything that users can regenerate automatically from other parts of the Corresponding Source.\r\n\r\nThe Corresponding Source for a work in source code form is that same work.\r\n\r\n2. Basic Permissions.\r\nAll rights granted under this License are granted for the term of copyright on the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated conditions are met. This License explicitly affirms your unlimited permission to run the unmodified Program. The output from running a covered work is covered by this License only if the output, given its content, constitutes a covered work. This License acknowledges your rights of fair use or other equivalent, as provided by copyright law.\r\n\r\nYou may make, run and propagate covered works that you do not convey, without conditions so long as your license otherwise remains in force. You may convey covered works to others for the sole purpose of having them make modifications exclusively for you, or provide you with facilities for running those works, provided that you comply with the terms of this License in conveying all material for which you do not control copyright. Those thus making or running the covered works for you must do so exclusively on your behalf, under your direction and control, on terms that prohibit them from making any copies of your copyrighted material outside their relationship with you.\r\n\r\nConveying under any other circumstances is permitted solely under the conditions stated below. Sublicensing is not allowed; section 10 makes it unnecessary.\r\n\r\n3. Protecting Users' Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law.\r\nNo covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological measure under any applicable law fulfilling obligations under article 11 of the WIPO copyright treaty adopted on 20 December 1996, or similar laws prohibiting or restricting circumvention of such measures.\r\n\r\nWhen you convey a covered work, you waive any legal power to forbid circumvention of technological measures to the extent such circumvention is effected by exercising rights under this License with respect to the covered work, and you disclaim any intention to limit operation or modification of the work as a means of enforcing, against the work's users, your or third parties' legal rights to forbid circumvention of technological measures.\r\n\r\n4. Conveying Verbatim Copies.\r\nYou may convey verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice; keep intact all notices stating that this License and any non-permissive terms added in accord with section 7 apply to the code; keep intact all notices of the absence of any warranty; and give all recipients a copy of this License along with the Program.\r\n\r\nYou may charge any price or no price for each copy that you convey, and you may offer support or warranty protection for a fee.\r\n\r\n5. Conveying Modified Source Versions.\r\nYou may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to produce it from the Program, in the form of source code under the terms of section 4, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:\r\n\r\na) The work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified it, and giving a relevant date.\r\nb) The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is released under this License and any conditions added under section 7. This requirement modifies the requirement in section 4 to “keep intact all notices”.\r\nc) You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this License to anyone who comes into possession of a copy. This License will therefore apply, along with any applicable section 7 additional terms, to the whole of the work, and all its parts, regardless of how they are packaged. This License gives no permission to license the work in any other way, but it does not invalidate such permission if you have separately received it.\r\nd) If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must display Appropriate Legal Notices; however, if the Program has interactive interfaces that do not display Appropriate Legal Notices, your work need not make them do so.\r\nA compilation of a covered work with other separate and independent works, which are not by their nature extensions of the covered work, and which are not combined with it such as to form a larger program, in or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is called an “aggregate” if the compilation and its resulting copyright are not used to limit the access or legal rights of the compilation's users beyond what the individual works permit. Inclusion of a covered work in an aggregate does not cause this License to apply to the other parts of the aggregate.\r\n\r\n6. Conveying Non-Source Forms.\r\nYou may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms of sections 4 and 5, provided that you also convey the machine-readable Corresponding Source under the terms of this License, in one of these ways:\r\n\r\na) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by the Corresponding Source fixed on a durable physical medium customarily used for software interchange.\r\nb) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by a written offer, valid for at least three years and valid for as long as you offer spare parts or customer support for that product model, to give anyone who possesses the object code either (1) a copy of the Corresponding Source for all the software in the product that is covered by this License, on a durable physical medium customarily used for software interchange, for a price no more than your reasonable cost of physically performing this conveying of source, or (2) access to copy the Corresponding Source from a network server at no charge.\r\nc) Convey individual copies of the object code with a copy of the written offer to provide the Corresponding Source. This alternative is allowed only occasionally and noncommercially, and only if you received the object code with such an offer, in accord with subsection 6b.\r\nd) Convey the object code by offering access from a designated place (gratis or for a charge), and offer equivalent access to the Corresponding Source in the same way through the same place at no further charge. You need not require recipients to copy the Corresponding Source along with the object code. If the place to copy the object code is a network server, the Corresponding Source may be on a different server (operated by you or a third party) that supports equivalent copying facilities, provided you maintain clear directions next to the object code saying where to find the Corresponding Source. Regardless of what server hosts the Corresponding Source, you remain obligated to ensure that it is available for as long as needed to satisfy these requirements.\r\ne) Convey the object code using peer-to-peer transmission, provided you inform other peers where the object code and Corresponding Source of the work are being offered to the general public at no charge under subsection 6d.\r\nA separable portion of the object code, whose source code is excluded from the Corresponding Source as a System Library, need not be included in conveying the object code work.\r\n\r\nA “User Product” is either (1) a “consumer product”, which means any tangible personal property which is normally used for personal, family, or household purposes, or (2) anything designed or sold for incorporation into a dwelling. In determining whether a product is a consumer product, doubtful cases shall be resolved in favor of coverage. For a particular product received by a particular user, “normally used” refers to a typical or common use of that class of product, regardless of the status of the particular user or of the way in which the particular user actually uses, or expects or is expected to use, the product. A product is a consumer product regardless of whether the product has substantial commercial, industrial or non-consumer uses, unless such uses represent the only significant mode of use of the product.\r\n\r\n“Installation Information” for a User Product means any methods, procedures, authorization keys, or other information required to install and execute modified versions of a covered work in that User Product from a modified version of its Corresponding Source. The information must suffice to ensure that the continued functioning of the modified object code is in no case prevented or interfered with solely because modification has been made.\r\n\r\nIf you convey an object code work under this section in, or with, or specifically for use in, a User Product, and the conveying occurs as part of a transaction in which the right of possession and use of the User Product is transferred to the recipient in perpetuity or for a fixed term (regardless of how the transaction is characterized), the Corresponding Source conveyed under this section must be accompanied by the Installation Information. But this requirement does not apply if neither you nor any third party retains the ability to install modified object code on the User Product (for example, the work has been installed in ROM).\r\n\r\nThe requirement to provide Installation Information does not include a requirement to continue to provide support service, warranty, or updates for a work that has been modified or installed by the recipient, or for the User Product in which it has been modified or installed. Access to a network may be denied when the modification itself materially and adversely affects the operation of the network or violates the rules and protocols for communication across the network.\r\n\r\nCorresponding Source conveyed, and Installation Information provided, in accord with this section must be in a format that is publicly documented (and with an implementation available to the public in source code form), and must require no special password or key for unpacking, reading or copying.\r\n\r\n7. Additional Terms.\r\n“Additional permissions” are terms that supplement the terms of this License by making exceptions from one or more of its conditions. Additional permissions that are applicable to the entire Program shall be treated as though they were included in this License, to the extent that they are valid under applicable law. If additional permissions apply only to part of the Program, that part may be used separately under those permissions, but the entire Program remains governed by this License without regard to the additional permissions.\r\n\r\nWhen you convey a copy of a covered work, you may at your option remove any additional permissions from that copy, or from any part of it. (Additional permissions may be written to require their own removal in certain cases when you modify the work.) You may place additional permissions on material, added by you to a covered work, for which you have or can give appropriate copyright permission.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding any other provision of this License, for material you add to a covered work, you may (if authorized by the copyright holders of that material) supplement the terms of this License with terms:\r\n\r\na) Disclaiming warranty or limiting liability differently from the terms of sections 15 and 16 of this License; or\r\nb) Requiring preservation of specified reasonable legal notices or author attributions in that material or in the Appropriate Legal Notices displayed by works containing it; or\r\nc) Prohibiting misrepresentation of the origin of that material, or requiring that modified versions of such material be marked in reasonable ways as different from the original version; or\r\nd) Limiting the use for publicity purposes of names of licensors or authors of the material; or\r\ne) Declining to grant rights under trademark law for use of some trade names, trademarks, or service marks; or\r\nf) Requiring indemnification of licensors and authors of that material by anyone who conveys the material (or modified versions of it) with contractual assumptions of liability to the recipient, for any liability that these contractual assumptions directly impose on those licensors and authors.\r\nAll other non-permissive additional terms are considered “further restrictions” within the meaning of section 10. If the Program as you received it, or any part of it, contains a notice stating that it is governed by this License along with a term that is a further restriction, you may remove that term. If a license document contains a further restriction but permits relicensing or conveying under this License, you may add to a covered work material governed by the terms of that license document, provided that the further restriction does not survive such relicensing or conveying.\r\n\r\nIf you add terms to a covered work in accord with this section, you must place, in the relevant source files, a statement of the additional terms that apply to those files, or a notice indicating where to find the applicable terms.\r\n\r\nAdditional terms, permissive or non-permissive, may be stated in the form of a separately written license, or stated as exceptions; the above requirements apply either way.\r\n\r\n8. Termination.\r\nYou may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise to propagate or modify it is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License (including any patent licenses granted under the third paragraph of section 11).\r\n\r\nHowever, if you cease all violation of this License, then your license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a) provisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and finally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright holder fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means prior to 60 days after the cessation.\r\n\r\nMoreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the violation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have received notice of violation of this License (for any work) from that copyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after your receipt of the notice.\r\n\r\nTermination of your rights under this section does not terminate the licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under this License. If your rights have been terminated and not permanently reinstated, you do not qualify to receive new licenses for the same material under section 10.\r\n\r\n9. Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies.\r\nYou are not required to accept this License in order to receive or run a copy of the Program. Ancillary propagation of a covered work occurring solely as a consequence of using peer-to-peer transmission to receive a copy likewise does not require acceptance. However, nothing other than this License grants you permission to propagate or modify any covered work. These actions infringe copyright if you do not accept this License. Therefore, by modifying or propagating a covered work, you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so.\r\n\r\n10. Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients.\r\nEach time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically receives a license from the original licensors, to run, modify and propagate that work, subject to this License. You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties with this License.\r\n\r\nAn “entity transaction” is a transaction transferring control of an organization, or substantially all assets of one, or subdividing an organization, or merging organizations. If propagation of a covered work results from an entity transaction, each party to that transaction who receives a copy of the work also receives whatever licenses to the work the party's predecessor in interest had or could give under the previous paragraph, plus a right to possession of the Corresponding Source of the work from the predecessor in interest, if the predecessor has it or can get it with reasonable efforts.\r\n\r\nYou may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the rights granted or affirmed under this License. For example, you may not impose a license fee, royalty, or other charge for exercise of rights granted under this License, and you may not initiate litigation (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that any patent claim is infringed by making, using, selling, offering for sale, or importing the Program or any portion of it.\r\n\r\n11. Patents.\r\nA “contributor” is a copyright holder who authorizes use under this License of the Program or a work on which the Program is based. The work thus licensed is called the contributor's “contributor version”.\r\n\r\nA contributor's “essential patent claims” are all patent claims owned or controlled by the contributor, whether already acquired or hereafter acquired, that would be infringed by some manner, permitted by this License, of making, using, or selling its contributor version, but do not include claims that would be infringed only as a consequence of further modification of the contributor version. For purposes of this definition, “control” includes the right to grant patent sublicenses in a manner consistent with the requirements of this License.\r\n\r\nEach contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free patent license under the contributor's essential patent claims, to make, use, sell, offer for sale, import and otherwise run, modify and propagate the contents of its contributor version.\r\n\r\nIn the following three paragraphs, a “patent license” is any express agreement or commitment, however denominated, not to enforce a patent (such as an express permission to practice a patent or covenant not to sue for patent infringement). To “grant” such a patent license to a party means to make such an agreement or commitment not to enforce a patent against the party.\r\n\r\nIf you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on a patent license, and the Corresponding Source of the work is not available for anyone to copy, free of charge and under the terms of this License, through a publicly available network server or other readily accessible means, then you must either (1) cause the Corresponding Source to be so available, or (2) arrange to deprive yourself of the benefit of the patent license for this particular work, or (3) arrange, in a manner consistent with the requirements of this License, to extend the patent license to downstream recipients. “Knowingly relying” means you have actual knowledge that, but for the patent license, your conveying the covered work in a country, or your recipient's use of the covered work in a country, would infringe one or more identifiable patents in that country that you have reason to believe are valid.\r\n\r\nIf, pursuant to or in connection with a single transaction or arrangement, you convey, or propagate by procuring conveyance of, a covered work, and grant a patent license to some of the parties receiving the covered work authorizing them to use, propagate, modify or convey a specific copy of the covered work, then the patent license you grant is automatically extended to all recipients of the covered work and works based on it.\r\n\r\nA patent license is “discriminatory” if it does not include within the scope of its coverage, prohibits the exercise of, or is conditioned on the non-exercise of one or more of the rights that are specifically granted under this License. You may not convey a covered work if you are a party to an arrangement with a third party that is in the business of distributing software, under which you make payment to the third party based on the extent of your activity of conveying the work, and under which the third party grants, to any of the parties who would receive the covered work from you, a discriminatory patent license (a) in connection with copies of the covered work conveyed by you (or copies made from those copies), or (b) primarily for and in connection with specific products or compilations that contain the covered work, unless you entered into that arrangement, or that patent license was granted, prior to 28 March 2007.\r\n\r\nNothing in this License shall be construed as excluding or limiting any implied license or other defenses to infringement that may otherwise be available to you under applicable patent law.\r\n\r\n12. No Surrender of Others' Freedom.\r\nIf conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not excuse you from the conditions of this License. If you cannot convey a covered work so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may not convey it at all. For example, if you agree to terms that obligate you to collect a royalty for further conveying from those to whom you convey the Program, the only way you could satisfy both those terms and this License would be to refrain entirely from conveying the Program.\r\n\r\n13. Use with the GNU Affero General Public License.\r\nNotwithstanding any other provision of this License, you have permission to link or combine any covered work with a work licensed under version 3 of the GNU Affero General Public License into a single combined work, and to convey the resulting work. The terms of this License will continue to apply to the part which is the covered work, but the special requirements of the GNU Affero General Public License, section 13, concerning interaction through a network will apply to the combination as such.\r\n\r\n14. Revised Versions of this License.\r\nThe Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of the GNU General Public License from time to time. Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.\r\n\r\nEach version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Program specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU General Public License “or any later version” applies to it, you have the option of following the terms and conditions either of that numbered version or of any later version published by the Free Software Foundation. If the Program does not specify a version number of the GNU General Public License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software Foundation.\r\n\r\nIf the Program specifies that a proxy can decide which future versions of the GNU General Public License can be used, that proxy's public statement of acceptance of a version permanently authorizes you to choose that version for the Program.\r\n\r\nLater license versions may give you additional or different permissions. However, no additional obligations are imposed on any author or copyright holder as a result of your choosing to follow a later version.\r\n\r\n15. Disclaimer of Warranty.\r\nTHERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM “AS IS” WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.\r\n\r\n16. Limitation of Liability.\r\nIN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MODIFIES AND/OR CONVEYS THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.\r\n\r\n17. Interpretation of Sections 15 and 16.\r\nIf the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability provided above cannot be given local legal effect according to their terms, reviewing courts shall apply local law that most closely approximates an absolute waiver of all civil liability in connection with the Program, unless a warranty or assumption of liability accompanies a copy of the Program in return for a fee.\r\n\r\nEND OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\r\n\r\nHow to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs\r\nIf you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.\r\n\r\nTo do so, attach the following notices to the program. It is safest to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively state the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the “copyright” line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.\r\n\r\n    <one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.>\r\n    Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>\r\n\r\n    This program is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify\r\n    it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by\r\n    the Free Software Foundation, either version 3 of the License, or\r\n    (at your option) any later version.\r\n\r\n    This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,\r\n    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of\r\n    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the\r\n    GNU General Public License for more details.\r\n\r\n    You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License\r\n    along with this program.  If not, see <http://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.\r\nAlso add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.\r\n\r\nIf the program does terminal interaction, make it output a short notice like this when it starts in an interactive mode:\r\n\r\n    <program>  Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>\r\n\r\n    This program comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w'.\r\n    This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it\r\n    under certain conditions; type `show c' for details.\r\nThe hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the appropriate parts of the General Public License. Of course, your program's commands might be different; for a GUI interface, you would use an “about box”.\r\n\r\nYou should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or school, if any, to sign a “copyright disclaimer” for the program, if necessary. For more information on this, and how to apply and follow the GNU GPL, see <http://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.\r\n\r\nThe GNU General Public License does not permit incorporating your program into proprietary programs. If your program is a subroutine library, you may consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with the library. If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Lesser General Public License instead of this License.

  {name: "lgplv21", description: "GNU Lesser General Public License 2.1", version: "2.1", category_id: 1, license_type_id: 2, flag_osi: true, text_license: "GNU Lesser General Public License\r\nVersion 2.1, February 1999\r\n\r\nCopyright (C) 1991, 1999 Free Software Foundation, Inc. 59 Temple Place, Suite 330, Boston, MA 02111-1307 USA Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.\r\n\r\n[This is the first released version of the Lesser GPL. It also counts as the successor of the GNU Library Public License, version 2, hence the version number 2.1.]\r\n\r\nPreamble\r\nThe licenses for most software are designed to take away your freedom to share and change it. By contrast, the GNU General Public Licenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.\r\n\r\nThis license, the Lesser General Public License, applies to some specially designated software packages--typically libraries--of the Free Software Foundation and other authors who decide to use it. You can use it too, but we suggest you first think carefully about whether this license or the ordinary General Public License is the better strategy to use in any particular case, based on the explanations below.\r\n\r\nWhen we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom of use, not price. Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for this service if you wish); that you receive source code or can get it if you want it; that you can change the software and use pieces of it in new free programs; and that you are informed that you can do these things.\r\n\r\nTo protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid distributors to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender these rights. These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you distribute copies of the library or if you modify it.\r\n\r\nFor example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that we gave you. You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code. If you link other code with the library, you must provide complete object files to the recipients, so that they can relink them with the library after making changes to the library and recompiling it. And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.\r\n\r\nWe protect your rights with a two-step method: (1) we copyright the library, and (2) we offer you this license, which gives you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the library.\r\n\r\nTo protect each distributor, we want to make it very clear that there is no warranty for the free library. Also, if the library is modified by someone else and passed on, the recipients should know that what they have is not the original version, so that the original author's reputation will not be affected by problems that might be introduced by others.\r\n\r\nFinally, software patents pose a constant threat to the existence of any free program. We wish to make sure that a company cannot effectively restrict the users of a free program by obtaining a restrictive license from a patent holder. Therefore, we insist that any patent license obtained for a version of the library must be consistent with the full freedom of use specified in this license.\r\n\r\nMost GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the ordinary GNU General Public License. This license, the GNU Lesser General Public License, applies to certain designated libraries, and is quite different from the ordinary General Public License. We use this license for certain libraries in order to permit linking those libraries into non-free programs.\r\n\r\nWhen a program is linked with a library, whether statically or using a shared library, the combination of the two is legally speaking a combined work, a derivative of the original library. The ordinary General Public License therefore permits such linking only if the entire combination fits its criteria of freedom. The Lesser General Public License permits more lax criteria for linking other code with the library.\r\n\r\nWe call this license the \"Lesser\" General Public License because it does Less to protect the user's freedom than the ordinary General Public License. It also provides other free software developers Less of an advantage over competing non-free programs. These disadvantages are the reason we use the ordinary General Public License for many libraries. However, the Lesser license provides advantages in certain special circumstances.\r\n\r\nFor example, on rare occasions, there may be a special need to encourage the widest possible use of a certain library, so that it becomes a de-facto standard. To achieve this, non-free programs must be allowed to use the library. A more frequent case is that a free library does the same job as widely used non-free libraries. In this case, there is little to gain by limiting the free library to free software only, so we use the Lesser General Public License.\r\n\r\nIn other cases, permission to use a particular library in non-free programs enables a greater number of people to use a large body of free software. For example, permission to use the GNU C Library in non-free programs enables many more people to use the whole GNU operating system, as well as its variant, the GNU/Linux operating system.\r\n\r\nAlthough the Lesser General Public License is Less protective of the users' freedom, it does ensure that the user of a program that is linked with the Library has the freedom and the wherewithal to run that program using a modified version of the Library.\r\n\r\nThe precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modification follow. Pay close attention to the difference between a \"work based on the library\" and a \"work that uses the library\". The former contains code derived from the library, whereas the latter must be combined with the library in order to run.\r\n\r\nTERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION\r\n0. This License Agreement applies to any software library or other program which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder or other authorized party saying it may be distributed under the terms of this Lesser General Public License (also called \"this License\"). Each licensee is addressed as \"you\".\r\n\r\nA \"library\" means a collection of software functions and/or data prepared so as to be conveniently linked with application programs (which use some of those functions and data) to form executables.\r\n\r\nThe \"Library\", below, refers to any such software library or work which has been distributed under these terms. A \"work based on the Library\" means either the Library or any derivative work under copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Library or a portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated straightforwardly into another language. (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in the term \"modification\".)\r\n\r\n\"Source code\" for a work means the preferred form of the work for making modifications to it. For a library, complete source code means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation and installation of the library.\r\n\r\nActivities other than copying, distribution and modification are not covered by this License; they are outside its scope. The act of running a program using the Library is not restricted, and output from such a program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the Library (independent of the use of the Library in a tool for writing it). Whether that is true depends on what the Library does and what the program that uses the Library does.\r\n\r\n1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Library's complete source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty; and distribute a copy of this License along with the Library.\r\n\r\nYou may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.\r\n\r\n2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any portion of it, thus forming a work based on the Library, and copy and distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1 above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:\r\n\r\na) The modified work must itself be a software library.\r\n\r\nb) You must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.\r\n\r\nc) You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no charge to all third parties under the terms of this License.\r\n\r\nd) If a facility in the modified Library refers to a function or a table of data to be supplied by an application program that uses the facility, other than as an argument passed when the facility is invoked, then you must make a good faith effort to ensure that, in the event an application does not supply such function or table, the facility still operates, and performs whatever part of its purpose remains meaningful.\r\n\r\n(For example, a function in a library to compute square roots has a purpose that is entirely well-defined independent of the application. Therefore, Subsection 2d requires that any application-supplied function or table used by this function must be optional: if the application does not supply it, the square root function must still compute square roots.)\r\n\r\nThese requirements apply to the modified work as a whole. If identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Library, and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those sections when you distribute them as separate works. But when you distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based on the Library, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.\r\n\r\nThus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or collective works based on the Library.\r\n\r\nIn addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Library with the Library (or with a work based on the Library) on a volume of a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under the scope of this License.\r\n\r\n3. You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General Public License instead of this License to a given copy of the Library. To do this, you must alter all the notices that refer to this License, so that they refer to the ordinary GNU General Public License, version 2, instead of to this License. (If a newer version than version 2 of the ordinary GNU General Public License has appeared, then you can specify that version instead if you wish.) Do not make any other change in these notices.\r\n\r\nOnce this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible for that copy, so the ordinary GNU General Public License applies to all subsequent copies and derivative works made from that copy.\r\n\r\nThis option is useful when you wish to copy part of the code of the Library into a program that is not a library.\r\n\r\n4. You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or derivative of it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange.\r\n\r\nIf distribution of object code is made by offering access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the source code from the same place satisfies the requirement to distribute the source code, even though third parties are not compelled to copy the source along with the object code.\r\n\r\n5. A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the Library, but is designed to work with the Library by being compiled or linked with it, is called a \"work that uses the Library\". Such a work, in isolation, is not a derivative work of the Library, and therefore falls outside the scope of this License.\r\n\r\nHowever, linking a \"work that uses the Library\" with the Library creates an executable that is a derivative of the Library (because it contains portions of the Library), rather than a \"work that uses the library\". The executable is therefore covered by this License. Section 6 states terms for distribution of such executables.\r\n\r\nWhen a \"work that uses the Library\" uses material from a header file that is part of the Library, the object code for the work may be a derivative work of the Library even though the source code is not. Whether this is true is especially significant if the work can be linked without the Library, or if the work is itself a library. The threshold for this to be true is not precisely defined by law.\r\n\r\nIf such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data structure layouts and accessors, and small macros and small inline functions (ten lines or less in length), then the use of the object file is unrestricted, regardless of whether it is legally a derivative work. (Executables containing this object code plus portions of the Library will still fall under Section 6.)\r\n\r\nOtherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you may distribute the object code for the work under the terms of Section 6. Any executables containing that work also fall under Section 6, whether or not they are linked directly with the Library itself.\r\n\r\n6. As an exception to the Sections above, you may also combine or link a \"work that uses the Library\" with the Library to produce a work containing portions of the Library, and distribute that work under terms of your choice, provided that the terms permit modification of the work for the customer's own use and reverse engineering for debugging such modifications.\r\n\r\nYou must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that the Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by this License. You must supply a copy of this License. If the work during execution displays copyright notices, you must include the copyright notice for the Library among them, as well as a reference directing the user to the copy of this License. Also, you must do one of these things:\r\n\r\na) Accompany the work with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code for the Library including whatever changes were used in the work (which must be distributed under Sections 1 and 2 above); and, if the work is an executable linked with the Library, with the complete machine-readable \"work that uses the Library\", as object code and/or source code, so that the user can modify the Library and then relink to produce a modified executable containing the modified Library. (It is understood that the user who changes the contents of definitions files in the Library will not necessarily be able to recompile the application to use the modified definitions.)\r\n\r\nb) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the Library. A suitable mechanism is one that (1) uses at run time a copy of the library already present on the user's computer system, rather than copying library functions into the executable, and (2) will operate properly with a modified version of the library, if the user installs one, as long as the modified version is interface-compatible with the version that the work was made with.\r\n\r\nc) Accompany the work with a written offer, valid for at least three years, to give the same user the materials specified in Subsection 6a, above, for a charge no more than the cost of performing this distribution.\r\n\r\nd) If distribution of the work is made by offering access to copy from a designated place, offer equivalent access to copy the above specified materials from the same place.\r\n\r\ne) Verify that the user has already received a copy of these materials or that you have already sent this user a copy.\r\n\r\nFor an executable, the required form of the \"work that uses the Library\" must include any data and utility programs needed for reproducing the executable from it. However, as a special exception, the materials to be distributed need not include anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies the executable.\r\n\r\nIt may happen that this requirement contradicts the license restrictions of other proprietary libraries that do not normally accompany the operating system. Such a contradiction means you cannot use both them and the Library together in an executable that you distribute.\r\n\r\n7. You may place library facilities that are a work based on the Library side-by-side in a single library together with other library facilities not covered by this License, and distribute such a combined library, provided that the separate distribution of the work based on the Library and of the other library facilities is otherwise permitted, and provided that you do these two things:\r\n\r\na) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work based on the Library, uncombined with any other library facilities. This must be distributed under the terms of the Sections above.\r\n\r\nb) Give prominent notice with the combined library of the fact that part of it is a work based on the Library, and explaining where to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same work.\r\n\r\n8. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute the Library except as expressly provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute the Library is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License. However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.\r\n\r\n9. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not signed it. However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or distribute the Library or its derivative works. These actions are prohibited by law if you do not accept this License. Therefore, by modifying or distributing the Library (or any work based on the Library), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying the Library or works based on it.\r\n\r\n10. Each time you redistribute the Library (or any work based on the Library), the recipient automatically receives a license from the original licensor to copy, distribute, link with or modify the Library subject to these terms and conditions. You may not impose any further restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein. You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties with this License.\r\n\r\n11. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues), conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not excuse you from the conditions of this License. If you cannot distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may not distribute the Library at all. For example, if a patent license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Library by all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to refrain entirely from distribution of the Library.\r\n\r\nIf any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply, and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.\r\n\r\nIt is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the integrity of the free software distribution system which is implemented by public license practices. Many people have made generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed through that system in reliance on consistent application of that system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot impose that choice.\r\n\r\nThis section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to be a consequence of the rest of this License.\r\n\r\n12. If the distribution and/or use of the Library is restricted in certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the original copyright holder who places the Library under this License may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus excluded. In such case, this License incorporates the limitation as if written in the body of this License.\r\n\r\n13. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of the Lesser General Public License from time to time. Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.\r\n\r\nEach version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Library specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and \"any later version\", you have the option of following the terms and conditions either of that version or of any later version published by the Free Software Foundation. If the Library does not specify a license version number, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software Foundation.\r\n\r\n14. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Library into other free programs whose distribution conditions are incompatible with these, write to the author to ask for permission. For software which is copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this. Our decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.\r\n\r\nNO WARRANTY\r\n\r\n15. BECAUSE THE LIBRARY IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE LIBRARY, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE LIBRARY \"AS IS\" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE LIBRARY IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE LIBRARY PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.\r\n\r\n16. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE LIBRARY AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE LIBRARY (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE LIBRARY TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER SOFTWARE), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.\r\n\r\nEND OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\r\nHow to Apply These Terms to Your New Libraries\r\nIf you develop a new library, and you want it to be of the greatest possible use to the public, we recommend making it free software that everyone can redistribute and change. You can do so by permitting redistribution under these terms (or, alternatively, under the terms of the ordinary General Public License).\r\nTo apply these terms, attach the following notices to the library.

Additional Definitions.\r\nAs used herein, “this License” refers to version 3 of the GNU Lesser General Public License, and the “GNU GPL” refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License.\r\n\r\n“The Library” refers to a covered work governed by this License, other than an Application or a Combined Work as defined below.\r\n\r\nAn “Application” is any work that makes use of an interface provided by the Library, but which is not otherwise based on the Library. Defining a subclass of a class defined by the Library is deemed a mode of using an interface provided by the Library.\r\n\r\nA “Combined Work” is a work produced by combining or linking an Application with the Library. The particular version of the Library with which the Combined Work was made is also called the “Linked Version”.\r\n\r\nThe “Minimal Corresponding Source” for a Combined Work means the Corresponding Source for the Combined Work, excluding any source code for portions of the Combined Work that, considered in isolation, are based on the Application, and not on the Linked Version.\r\n\r\nThe “Corresponding Application Code” for a Combined Work means the object code and/or source code for the Application, including any data and utility programs needed for reproducing the Combined Work from the Application, but excluding the System Libraries of the Combined Work.\r\n\r\n1. Exception to Section 3 of the GNU GPL.\r\nYou may convey a covered work under sections 3 and 4 of this License without being bound by section 3 of the GNU GPL.\r\n\r\n2. Conveying Modified Versions.\r\nIf you modify a copy of the Library, and, in your modifications, a facility refers to a function or data to be supplied by an Application that uses the facility (other than as an argument passed when the facility is invoked), then you may convey a copy of the modified version:\r\n\r\na) under this License, provided that you make a good faith effort to ensure that, in the event an Application does not supply the function or data, the facility still operates, and performs whatever part of its purpose remains meaningful, or\r\nb) under the GNU GPL, with none of the additional permissions of this License applicable to that copy.\r\n3. Object Code Incorporating Material from Library Header Files.\r\nThe object code form of an Application may incorporate material from a header file that is part of the Library. You may convey such object code under terms of your choice, provided that, if the incorporated material is not limited to numerical parameters, data structure layouts and accessors, or small macros, inline functions and templates (ten or fewer lines in length), you do both of the following:\r\n\r\na) Give prominent notice with each copy of the object code that the Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by this License.\r\nb) Accompany the object code with a copy of the GNU GPL and this license document.\r\n4. Combined Works.\r\nYou may convey a Combined Work under terms of your choice that, taken together, effectively do not restrict modification of the portions of the Library contained in the Combined Work and reverse engineering for debugging such modifications, if you also do each of the following:\r\n\r\na) Give prominent notice with each copy of the Combined Work that the Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by this License.\r\nb) Accompany the Combined Work with a copy of the GNU GPL and this license document.\r\nc) For a Combined Work that displays copyright notices during execution, include the copyright notice for the Library among these notices, as well as a reference directing the user to the copies of the GNU GPL and this license document.\r\nd) Do one of the following:\r\n0) Convey the Minimal Corresponding Source under the terms of this License, and the Corresponding Application Code in a form suitable for, and under terms that permit, the user to recombine or relink the Application with a modified version of the Linked Version to produce a modified Combined Work, in the manner specified by section 6 of the GNU GPL for conveying Corresponding Source.\r\n1) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the Library. A suitable mechanism is one that (a) uses at run time a copy of the Library already present on the user's computer system, and (b) will operate properly with a modified version of the Library that is interface-compatible with the Linked Version.\r\ne) Provide Installation Information, but only if you would otherwise be required to provide such information under section 6 of the GNU GPL, and only to the extent that such information is necessary to install and execute a modified version of the Combined Work produced by recombining or relinking the Application with a modified version of the Linked Version. (If you use option 4d0, the Installation Information must accompany the Minimal Corresponding Source and Corresponding Application Code. If you use option 4d1, you must provide the Installation Information in the manner specified by section 6 of the GNU GPL for conveying Corresponding Source.)\r\n5. Combined Libraries.\r\nYou may place library facilities that are a work based on the Library side by side in a single library together with other library facilities that are not Applications and are not covered by this License, and convey such a combined library under terms of your choice, if you do both of the following:\r\n\r\na) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work based on the Library, uncombined with any other library facilities, conveyed under the terms of this License.\r\nb) Give prominent notice with the combined library that part of it is a work based on the Library, and explaining where to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same work.\r\n6. Revised Versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License.\r\nThe Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License from time to time. Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.\r\n\r\nEach version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Library as you received it specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU Lesser General Public License “or any later version” applies to it, you have the option of following the terms and conditions either of that published version or of any later version published by the Free Software Foundation. If the Library as you received it does not specify a version number of the GNU Lesser General Public License, you may choose any version of the GNU Lesser General Public License ever published by the Free Software Foundation.\r\n\r\nIf the Library as you received it specifies that a proxy can decide whether future versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License shall apply, that proxy's public statement of acceptance of any version is permanent authorization for you to choose that version for the Library.", notes: "", similar_license_id: nil},

Grants\r\nEach Contributor hereby grants You a world-wide, royalty-free, non-exclusive license:\r\n\r\nunder intellectual property rights (other than patent or trademark) Licensable by such Contributor to use, reproduce, make available, modify, display, perform, distribute, and otherwise exploit its Contributions, either on an unmodified basis, with Modifications, or as part of a Larger Work; and\r\n\r\nunder Patent Claims of such Contributor to make, use, sell, offer for sale, have made, import, and otherwise transfer either its Contributions or its Contributor Version.\r\n\r\n2.2. Effective Date\r\nThe licenses granted in Section 2.1 with respect to any Contribution become effective for each Contribution on the date the Contributor first distributes such Contribution.\r\n\r\n2.3. Limitations on Grant Scope\r\nThe licenses granted in this Section 2 are the only rights granted under this License. No additional rights or licenses will be implied from the distribution or licensing of Covered Software under this License. Notwithstanding Section 2.1(b) above, no patent license is granted by a Contributor:\r\n\r\nfor any code that a Contributor has removed from Covered Software; or\r\n\r\nfor infringements caused by: (i) Your and any other third party’s modifications of Covered Software, or (ii) the combination of its Contributions with other software (except as part of its Contributor Version); or\r\n\r\nunder Patent Claims infringed by Covered Software in the absence of its Contributions.\r\n\r\nThis License does not grant any rights in the trademarks, service marks, or logos of any Contributor (except as may be necessary to comply with the notice requirements in Section 3.4).\r\n\r\n2.4. Subsequent Licenses\r\nNo Contributor makes additional grants as a result of Your choice to distribute the Covered Software under a subsequent version of this License (see Section 10.2) or under the terms of a Secondary License (if permitted under the terms of Section 3.3).\r\n\r\n2.5. Representation\r\nEach Contributor represents that the Contributor believes its Contributions are its original creation(s) or it has sufficient rights to grant the rights to its Contributions conveyed by this License.\r\n\r\n2.6. Fair Use\r\nThis License is not intended to limit any rights You have under applicable copyright doctrines of fair use, fair dealing, or other equivalents.\r\n\r\n2.7. Conditions\r\nSections 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, and 3.4 are conditions of the licenses granted in Section 2.1.\r\n\r\n3. Responsibilities\r\n3.1. Distribution of Source Form\r\nAll distribution of Covered Software in Source Code Form, including any Modifications that You create or to which You contribute, must be under the terms of this License. You must inform recipients that the Source Code Form of the Covered Software is governed by the terms of this License, and how they can obtain a copy of this License. You may not attempt to alter or restrict the recipients’ rights in the Source Code Form.\r\n\r\n3.2. Distribution of Executable Form\r\nIf You distribute Covered Software in Executable Form then:\r\n\r\nsuch Covered Software must also be made available in Source Code Form, as described in Section 3.1, and You must inform recipients of the Executable Form how they can obtain a copy of such Source Code Form by reasonable means in a timely manner, at a charge no more than the cost of distribution to the recipient; and\r\n\r\nYou may distribute such Executable Form under the terms of this License, or sublicense it under different terms, provided that the license for the Executable Form does not attempt to limit or alter the recipients’ rights in the Source Code Form under this License.\r\n\r\n3.3. Distribution of a Larger Work\r\nYou may create and distribute a Larger Work under terms of Your choice, provided that You also comply with the requirements of this License for the Covered Software. If the Larger Work is a combination of Covered Software with a work governed by one or more Secondary Licenses, and the Covered Software is not Incompatible With Secondary Licenses, this License permits You to additionally distribute such Covered Software under the terms of such Secondary License(s), so that the recipient of the Larger Work may, at their option, further distribute the Covered Software under the terms of either this License or such Secondary License(s).\r\n\r\n3.4. Notices\r\nYou may not remove or alter the substance of any license notices (including copyright notices, patent notices, disclaimers of warranty, or limitations of liability) contained within the Source Code Form of the Covered Software, except that You may alter any license notices to the extent required to remedy known factual inaccuracies.\r\n\r\n3.5. Application of Additional Terms\r\nYou may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligations to one or more recipients of Covered Software. However, You may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on behalf of any Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear that any such warranty, support, indemnity, or liability obligation is offered by You alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify every Contributor for any liability incurred by such Contributor as a result of warranty, support, indemnity or liability terms You offer. You may include additional disclaimers of warranty and limitations of liability specific to any jurisdiction.\r\n\r\n4. Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation\r\nIf it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this License with respect to some or all of the Covered Software due to statute, judicial order, or regulation then You must: (a) comply with the terms of this License to the maximum extent possible; and (b) describe the limitations and the code they affect. Such description must be placed in a text file included with all distributions of the Covered Software under this License. Except to the extent prohibited by statute or regulation, such description must be sufficiently detailed for a recipient of ordinary skill to be able to understand it.\r\n\r\n5. Termination\r\n5.1. The rights granted under this License will terminate automatically if You fail to comply with any of its terms. However, if You become compliant, then the rights granted under this License from a particular Contributor are reinstated (a) provisionally, unless and until such Contributor explicitly and finally terminates Your grants, and (b) on an ongoing basis, if such Contributor fails to notify You of the non-compliance by some reasonable means prior to 60 days after You have come back into compliance. Moreover, Your grants from a particular Contributor are reinstated on an ongoing basis if such Contributor notifies You of the non-compliance by some reasonable means, this is the first time You have received notice of non-compliance with this License from such Contributor, and You become compliant prior to 30 days after Your receipt of the notice.\r\n\r\n5.2. If You initiate litigation against any entity by asserting a patent infringement claim (excluding declaratory judgment actions, counter-claims, and cross-claims) alleging that a Contributor Version directly or indirectly infringes any patent, then the rights granted to You by any and all Contributors for the Covered Software under Section 2.1 of this License shall terminate.\r\n\r\n5.3. In the event of termination under Sections 5.1 or 5.2 above, all end user license agreements (excluding distributors and resellers) which have been validly granted by You or Your distributors under this License prior to termination shall survive termination.\r\n\r\n6. Disclaimer of Warranty\r\nCovered Software is provided under this License on an “as is” basis, without warranty of any kind, either expressed, implied, or statutory, including, without limitation, warranties that the Covered Software is free of defects, merchantable, fit for a particular purpose or non-infringing. The entire risk as to the quality and performance of the Covered Software is with You. Should any Covered Software prove defective in any respect, You (not any Contributor) assume the cost of any necessary servicing, repair, or correction. This disclaimer of warranty constitutes an essential part of this License. No use of any Covered Software is authorized under this License except under this disclaimer.\r\n\r\n7. Limitation of Liability\r\nUnder no circumstances and under no legal theory, whether tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise, shall any Contributor, or anyone who distributes Covered Software as permitted above, be liable to You for any direct, indirect, special, incidental, or consequential damages of any character including, without limitation, damages for lost profits, loss of goodwill, work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all other commercial damages or losses, even if such party shall have been informed of the possibility of such damages. This limitation of liability shall not apply to liability for death or personal injury resulting from such party’s negligence to the extent applicable law prohibits such limitation. Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or limitation of incidental or consequential damages, so this exclusion and limitation may not apply to You.\r\n\r\n8. Litigation\r\nAny litigation relating to this License may be brought only in the courts of a jurisdiction where the defendant maintains its principal place of business and such litigation shall be governed by laws of that jurisdiction, without reference to its conflict-of-law provisions. Nothing in this Section shall prevent a party’s ability to bring cross-claims or counter-claims.\r\n\r\n9. Miscellaneous\r\nThis License represents the complete agreement concerning the subject matter hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be unenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only to the extent necessary to make it enforceable. Any law or regulation which provides that the language of a contract shall be construed against the drafter shall not be used to construe this License against a Contributor.\r\n\r\n10. Versions of the License\r\n10.1. New Versions\r\nMozilla Foundation is the license steward. Except as provided in Section 10.3, no one other than the license steward has the right to modify or publish new versions of this License. Each version will be given a distinguishing version number.\r\n\r\n10.2. Effect of New Versions\r\nYou may distribute the Covered Software under the terms of the version of the License under which You originally received the Covered Software, or under the terms of any subsequent version published by the license steward.\r\n\r\n10.3. Modified Versions\r\nIf you create software not governed by this License, and you want to create a new license for such software, you may create and use a modified version of this License if you rename the license and remove any references to the name of the license steward (except to note that such modified license differs from this License).\r\n\r\n10.4. Distributing Source Code Form that is Incompatible With Secondary Licenses\r\nIf You choose to distribute Source Code Form that is Incompatible With Secondary Licenses under the terms of this version of the License, the notice described in Exhibit B of this License must be attached.\r\n\r\nExhibit A - Source Code Form License Notice\r\nThis Source Code Form is subject to the terms of the Mozilla Public License, v. 2.0. If a copy of the MPL was not distributed with this file, You can obtain one at http://mozilla.org/MPL/2.0/.\r\n\r\nIf it is not possible or desirable to put the notice in a particular file, then You may include the notice in a location (such as a LICENSE file in a relevant directory) where a recipient would be likely to look for such a notice.\r\n\r\nYou may add additional accurate notices of copyright ownership.\r\n\r\nExhibit B - “Incompatible With Secondary Licenses” Notice\r\nThis Source Code Form is “Incompatible With Secondary Licenses”, as defined by the Mozilla Public License, v. 2.0.", notes: "", similar_license_id: nil},

You must make it absolutely clear that any such warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligation is offered by You alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify the Initial Developer and every Contributor for any liability incurred by the Initial Developer or such Contributor as a result of warranty, support, indemnity or liability terms You offer.\r\n\r\n3.5. Distribution of Executable Versions.\r\n\r\nYou may distribute the Executable form of the Covered Software under the terms of this License or under the terms of a license of Your choice, which may contain terms different from this License, provided that You are in compliance with the terms of this License and that the license for the Executable form does not attempt to limit or alter the recipients rights in the Source Code form from the rights set forth in this License. If You distribute the Covered Software in Executable form under a different license, You must make it absolutely clear that any terms which differ from this License are offered by You alone, not by the Initial Developer or Contributor. You hereby agree to indemnify the Initial Developer and every Contributor for any liability incurred by the Initial Developer or such Contributor as a result of any such terms You offer.\r\n\r\n3.6. Larger Works.\r\n\r\nYou may create a Larger Work by combining Covered Software with other code not governed by the terms of this License and distribute the Larger Work as a single product. In such a case, You must make sure the requirements of this License are fulfilled for the Covered Software.\r\n\r\n4. Versions of the License.\r\n\r\n4.1. New Versions.\r\n\r\nSun Microsystems, Inc. is the initial license steward and may publish revised and/or new versions of this License from time to time. Each version will be given a distinguishing version number. Except as provided in Section 4.3, no one other than the license steward has the right to modify this License.\r\n\r\n4.2. Effect of New Versions.\r\n\r\nYou may always continue to use, distribute or otherwise make the Covered Software available under the terms of the version of the License under which You originally received the Covered Software. If the Initial Developer includes a notice in the Original Software prohibiting it from being distributed or otherwise made available under any subsequent version of the License, You must distribute and make the Covered Software available under the terms of the version of the License under which You originally received the Covered Software. Otherwise, You may also choose to use, distribute or otherwise make the Covered Software available under the terms of any subsequent version of the License published by the license steward.\r\n\r\n4.3. Modified Versions.\r\n\r\nWhen You are an Initial Developer and You want to create a new license for Your Original Software, You may create and use a modified version of this License if You: (a) rename the license and remove any references to the name of the license steward (except to note that the license differs from this License); and (b) otherwise make it clear that the license contains terms which differ from this License.\r\n\r\n5. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY.\r\n\r\nCOVERED SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED UNDER THIS LICENSE ON AN AS IS BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES THAT THE COVERED SOFTWARE IS FREE OF DEFECTS, MERCHANTABLE, FIT FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR NON-INFRINGING.

SHOULD ANY COVERED SOFTWARE PROVE DEFECTIVE IN ANY RESPECT, YOU (NOT THE INITIAL DEVELOPER OR ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR) ASSUME THE COST OF ANY NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION. THIS DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY CONSTITUTES AN ESSENTIAL PART OF THIS LICENSE. NO USE OF ANY COVERED SOFTWARE IS AUTHORIZED HEREUNDER EXCEPT UNDER THIS DISCLAIMER.\r\n\r\n6. TERMINATION.\r\n\r\n6.1. This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate automatically if You fail to comply with terms herein and fail to cure such breach within 30 days of becoming aware of the breach. Provisions which, by their nature, must remain in effect beyond the termination of this License shall survive.\r\n\r\n6.2. If You assert a patent infringement claim (excluding declaratory judgment actions) against Initial Developer or a Contributor (the Initial Developer or Contributor against whom You assert such claim is referred to as Participant) alleging that the Participant Software (meaning the Contributor Version where the Participant is a Contributor or the Original Software where the Participant is the Initial Developer) directly or indirectly infringes any patent, then any and all rights granted directly or indirectly to You by such Participant, the Initial Developer (if the Initial Developer is not the Participant) and all Contributors under Sections 2.1 and/or 2.2 of this License shall, upon 60 days notice from Participant terminate prospectively and automatically at the expiration of such 60 day notice period, unless if within such 60 day period You withdraw Your claim with respect to the Participant Software against such Participant either unilaterally or pursuant to a written agreement with Participant.\r\n\r\n6.3. In the event of termination under Sections 6.1 or 6.2 above, all end user licenses that have been validly granted by You or any distributor hereunder prior to termination (excluding licenses granted to You by any distributor) shall survive termination.\r\n\r\n7. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY.\r\n\r\nUNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES AND UNDER NO LEGAL THEORY, WHETHER TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), CONTRACT, OR OTHERWISE, SHALL YOU, THE INITIAL DEVELOPER, ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR, OR ANY DISTRIBUTOR OF COVERED SOFTWARE, OR ANY SUPPLIER OF ANY OF SUCH PARTIES, BE LIABLE TO ANY PERSON FOR ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY CHARACTER INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, DAMAGES FOR LOST PROFITS, LOSS OF GOODWILL, WORK STOPPAGE, COMPUTER FAILURE OR MALFUNCTION, OR ANY AND ALL OTHER COMMERCIAL DAMAGES OR LOSSES, EVEN IF SUCH PARTY SHALL HAVE BEEN INFORMED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. THIS LIMITATION OF LIABILITY SHALL NOT APPLY TO LIABILITY FOR DEATH OR PERSONAL INJURY RESULTING FROM SUCH PARTYS NEGLIGENCE TO THE EXTENT APPLICABLE LAW PROHIBITS SUCH LIMITATION. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO THIS EXCLUSION AND LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.\r\n\r\n8. U.S. GOVERNMENT END USERS.\r\n\r\nThe Covered Software is a commercial item, as that term is defined in 48 C.F.R. 2.101 (Oct. 1995), consisting of commercial computer software (as that term is defined at 48 C.F.R.  252.227-7014(a)(1)) and commercial computer software documentation as such terms are used in 48 C.F.R. 12.212 (Sept. 1995). Consistent with 48 C.F.R. 12.212 and 48 C.F.R. 227.7202-1 through 227.7202-4 (June 1995), all U.S. Government End Users acquire Covered Software with only those rights set forth herein. This U.S. Government Rights clause is in lieu of, and supersedes, any other FAR, DFAR, or other clause or provision that addresses Government rights in computer software under this License.\r\n\r\n9. MISCELLANEOUS.\r\n\r\nThis License represents the complete agreement concerning subject matter hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be unenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only to the extent necessary to make it enforceable. This License shall be governed by the law of the jurisdiction specified in a notice contained within the Original Software (except to the extent applicable law, if any, provides otherwise), excluding such jurisdictions conflict-of-law provisions. Any litigation relating to this License shall be subject to the jurisdiction of the courts located in the jurisdiction and venue specified in a notice contained within the Original Software, with the losing party responsible for costs, including, without limitation, court costs and reasonable attorneys fees and expenses. The application of the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods is expressly excluded. Any law or regulation which provides that the language of a contract shall be construed against the drafter shall not apply to this License. You agree that You alone are responsible for compliance with the United States export administration regulations (and the export control laws and regulation of any other countries) when You use, distribute or otherwise make available any Covered Software.\r\n\r\n10. RESPONSIBILITY FOR CLAIMS.\r\n\r\nAs between Initial Developer and the Contributors, each party is responsible for claims and damages arising, directly or indirectly, out of its utilization of rights under this License and You agree to work with Initial Developer and Contributors to distribute such responsibility on an equitable basis. Nothing herein is intended or shall be deemed to constitute any admission of liability.\r\n", notes: "", similar_license_id: 63},

ANY USE, REPRODUCTION OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM CONSTITUTES RECIPIENT'S ACCEPTANCE OF THIS AGREEMENT.\r\n\r\n1. DEFINITIONS\r\n\r\n\"Contribution\" means:\r\n\r\na) in the case of the initial Contributor, the initial code and documentation distributed under this Agreement, and \r\nb) in the case of each subsequent Contributor: \r\ni) changes to the Program, and \r\nii) additions to the Program;\r\nwhere such changes and/or additions to the Program originate from and are distributed by that particular Contributor. A Contribution 'originates' from a Contributor if it was added to the Program by such Contributor itself or anyone acting on such Contributor's behalf. Contributions do not include additions to the Program which: (i) are separate modules of software distributed in conjunction with the Program under their own license agreement, and (ii) are not derivative works of the Program.\r\n\"Contributor\" means any person or entity that distributes the Program.\r\n\r\n\"Licensed Patents \" mean patent claims licensable by a Contributor which are necessarily infringed by the use or sale of its Contribution alone or when combined with the Program.\r\n\r\n\"Program\" means the Contributions distributed in accordance with this Agreement.\r\n\r\n\"Recipient\" means anyone who receives the Program under this Agreement, including all Contributors.\r\n\r\n2. GRANT OF RIGHTS\r\n\r\na) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby grants Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free copyright license to reproduce, prepare derivative works of, publicly display, publicly perform, distribute and sublicense the Contribution of such Contributor, if any, and such derivative works, in source code and object code form. \r\nb) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby grants Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free patent license under Licensed Patents to make, use, sell, offer to sell, import and otherwise transfer the Contribution of such Contributor, if any, in source code and object code form. This patent license shall apply to the combination of the Contribution and the Program if, at the time the Contribution is added by the Contributor, such addition of the Contribution causes such combination to be covered by the Licensed Patents. The patent license shall not apply to any other combinations which include the Contribution. No hardware per se is licensed hereunder. \r\nc) Recipient understands that although each Contributor grants the licenses to its Contributions set forth herein, no assurances are provided by any Contributor that the Program does not infringe the patent or other intellectual property rights of any other entity. Each Contributor disclaims any liability to Recipient for claims brought by any other entity based on infringement of intellectual property rights or otherwise. As a condition to exercising the rights and licenses granted hereunder, each Recipient hereby assumes sole responsibility to secure any other intellectual property rights needed, if any. For example, if a third party patent license is required to allow Recipient to distribute the Program, it is Recipient's responsibility to acquire that license before distributing the Program. \r\nd) Each Contributor represents that to its knowledge it has sufficient copyright rights in its Contribution, if any, to grant the copyright license set forth in this Agreement.\r\n3. REQUIREMENTS\r\n\r\nA Contributor may choose to distribute the Program in object code form under its own license agreement, provided that:\r\n\r\na) it complies with the terms and conditions of this Agreement; and \r\nb) its license agreement: \r\ni) effectively disclaims on behalf of all Contributors all warranties and conditions, express and implied, including warranties or conditions of title and non-infringement, and implied warranties or conditions of merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose; \r\nii) effectively excludes on behalf of all Contributors all liability for damages, including direct, indirect, special, incidental and consequential damages, such as lost profits; \r\niii) states that any provisions which differ from this Agreement are offered by that Contributor alone and not by any other party; and \r\niv) states that source code for the Program is available from such Contributor, and informs licensees how to obtain it in a reasonable manner on or through a medium customarily used for software exchange.\r\nWhen the Program is made available in source code form:\r\n\r\na) it must be made available under this Agreement; and \r\nb) a copy of this Agreement must be included with each copy of the Program.\r\nContributors may not remove or alter any copyright notices contained within the Program.\r\nEach Contributor must identify itself as the originator of its Contribution, if any, in a manner that reasonably allows subsequent Recipients to identify the originator of the Contribution.\r\n\r\n4. COMMERCIAL DISTRIBUTION\r\n\r\nCommercial distributors of software may accept certain responsibilities with respect to end users, business partners and the like. While this license is intended to facilitate the commercial use of the Program, the Contributor who includes the Program in a commercial product offering should do so in a manner which does not create potential liability for other Contributors. Therefore, if a Contributor includes the Program in a commercial product offering, such Contributor (\"Commercial Contributor\") hereby agrees to defend and indemnify every other Contributor (\"Indemnified Contributor\") against any losses, damages and costs (collectively \"Losses\") arising from claims, lawsuits and other legal actions brought by a third party against the Indemnified Contributor to the extent caused by the acts or omissions of such Commercial Contributor in connection with its distribution of the Program in a commercial product offering. The obligations in this section do not apply to any claims or Losses relating to any actual or alleged intellectual property infringement. In order to qualify, an Indemnified Contributor must: a) promptly notify the Commercial Contributor in writing of such claim, and b) allow the Commercial Contributor to control, and cooperate with the Commercial Contributor in, the defense and any related settlement negotiations. The Indemnified Contributor may participate in any such claim at its own expense.\r\n\r\nFor example, a Contributor might include the Program in a commercial product offering, Product X. That Contributor is then a Commercial Contributor. If that Commercial Contributor then makes performance claims, or offers warranties related to Product X, those performance claims and warranties are such Commercial Contributor's responsibility alone. Under this section, the Commercial Contributor would have to defend claims against the other Contributors related to those performance claims and warranties, and if a court requires any other Contributor to pay any damages as a result, the Commercial Contributor must pay those damages.\r\n\r\n5. NO WARRANTY\r\n\r\nEXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, THE PROGRAM IS PROVIDED ON AN \"AS IS\" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. Each Recipient is solely responsible for determining the appropriateness of using and distributing the Program and assumes all risks associated with its exercise of rights under this Agreement , including but not limited to the risks and costs of program errors, compliance with applicable laws, damage to or loss of data, programs or equipment, and unavailability or interruption of operations.\r\n\r\n6. DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY\r\n\r\nEXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, NEITHER RECIPIENT NOR ANY CONTRIBUTORS SHALL HAVE ANY LIABILITY FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES (INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION LOST PROFITS), HOWEVER CAUSED AND ON ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY, WHETHER IN CONTRACT, STRICT LIABILITY, OR TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE OR OTHERWISE) ARISING IN ANY WAY OUT OF THE USE OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM OR THE EXERCISE OF ANY RIGHTS GRANTED HEREUNDER, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.\r\n\r\n7. GENERAL\r\n\r\nIf any provision of this Agreement is invalid or unenforceable under applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of the remainder of the terms of this Agreement, and without further action by the parties hereto, such provision shall be reformed to the minimum extent necessary to make such provision valid and enforceable.\r\n\r\nIf Recipient institutes patent litigation against any entity (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Program itself (excluding combinations of the Program with other software or hardware) infringes such Recipient's patent(s), then such Recipient's rights granted under Section 2(b) shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed.\r\n\r\nAll Recipient's rights under this Agreement shall terminate if it fails to comply with any of the material terms or conditions of this Agreement and does not cure such failure in a reasonable period of time after becoming aware of such noncompliance. If all Recipient's rights under this Agreement terminate, Recipient agrees to cease use and distribution of the Program as soon as reasonably practicable. However, Recipient's obligations under this Agreement and any licenses granted by Recipient relating to the Program shall continue and survive.\r\n\r\nEveryone is permitted to copy and distribute copies of this Agreement, but in order to avoid inconsistency the Agreement is copyrighted and may only be modified in the following manner. The Agreement Steward reserves the right to publish new versions (including revisions) of this Agreement from time to time. No one other than the Agreement Steward has the right to modify this Agreement. The Eclipse Foundation is the initial Agreement Steward. The Eclipse Foundation may assign the responsibility to serve as the Agreement Steward to a suitable separate entity. Each new version of the Agreement will be given a distinguishing version number. The Program (including Contributions) may always be distributed subject to the version of the Agreement under which it was received. In addition, after a new version of the Agreement is published, Contributor may elect to distribute the Program (including its Contributions) under the new version. Except as expressly stated in Sections 2(a) and 2(b) above, Recipient receives no rights or licenses to the intellectual property of any Contributor under this Agreement, whether expressly, by implication, estoppel or otherwise. All rights in the Program not expressly granted under this Agreement are reserved.\r\n\r\nThis Agreement is governed by the laws of the State of New York and the intellectual property laws of the United States of America. No party to this Agreement will bring a legal action under this Agreement more than one year after the cause of action arose. Each party waives its rights to a jury trial in any resulting litigation.", notes: "estratto da: http://www.eclipse.org/legal/eplfaq.php\r\n\r\nCan I take a Program licensed under the EPL, compile it without modification, and commercially license the result?\r\nYes. You may compile a Program licensed under the EPL without modification and commercially license the result in accordance with the terms of the EPL.\r\n\r\nDo I need to include the source code for such Program with the object code distribution?\r\nNo. But you do need to include a statement that the source code is available from you and information on how to obtain it.\r\n\r\nWhen I incorporate a portion of a Program licensed under the EPL into my own proprietary product distributed in object code form, can I use a single license for the full product, in other words, covering the portion of the Program plus my own code?\r\nYes. The object code for the product may be distributed under a single license as long as it references the EPL portion and complies, for that portion, with the terms of the EPL.", similar_license_id: 85},

A Subsequent Work will \"originate\" from a Subsequent Contributor if the Subsequent Work was a result of efforts by such Subsequent Contributor (or anyone acting on such Subsequent Contributor's behalf, such as, a contractor or other entity that is engaged by or under the direction of the Subsequent Contributor). For greater certainty, a Subsequent Work expressly excludes and shall not capture within its meaning any Independent Module.\r\n\r\n1.19. \"SUPPLEMENT FILE\" means a file distributed with the Licensed Work having a file name \"suppfile.txt\".\r\n\r\n1.20. \"THIRD PARTY\" has the meaning assigned in Part 4 of Exhibit A.\r\n\r\n2. LICENSE.\r\n\r\n2.1. COPYRIGHT LICENSE FROM INITIAL AND SUBSEQUENT CONTRIBUTORS.\r\n\r\n(a) Subject to the terms of this License, the Initial Contributor hereby grants each Recipient a world-wide, royalty-free, non-exclusive copyright license to:\r\n\r\n(i) reproduce, prepare derivative works of, publicly display, publicly perform, distribute and sublicense the Initial Work; and\r\n\r\n(ii) reproduce, publicly display, publicly perform, distribute, and sublicense any derivative works (if any) prepared by Recipient;\r\n\r\nin Source Code and Executable form, either with other Modifications, on an unmodified basis, or as part of a Larger Work.\r\n\r\n(b) Subject to the terms of this License, each Subsequent Contributor hereby grants each Recipient a world-wide, royalty-free, non-exclusive copyright license to:\r\n\r\n(i) reproduce, prepare derivative works of, publicly display, publicly perform, distribute and sublicense the Subsequent Work of such Subsequent Contributor; and\r\n\r\n(ii) reproduce, publicly display, publicly perform, distribute, and sublicense any derivative works (if any) prepared by Recipient;\r\n\r\nin Source Code and Executable form, either with other Modifications, on an unmodified basis, or as part of a Larger Work.\r\n2.2. PATENT LICENSE FROM INITIAL AND SUBSEQUENT CONTRIBUTORS.\r\n\r\n(a) This License does not include or grant any patent license whatsoever from the Initial Contributor, Subsequent Contributor, or any Distributor unless, at the time the Initial Work is first distributed or made available under this License (as the case may be), the Initial Contributor has selected pursuant to Part 6 of Exhibit A the patent terms in paragraphs A, B, C, D and E from Part 6 of Exhibit A. If this is not done then the Initial Work and any other Subsequent Work is made available under the License without any patent license (the \"PATENTS-EXCLUDED LICENSE\").\r\n\r\n(b) However, the Initial Contributor may subsequently distribute or make available (as the case may be) future copies of: (1) the Initial Work; or (2) any Licensed Work distributed by the Initial Contributor which includes the Initial Work (or any portion thereof) and/or any Modification made by the Initial Contributor; available under a License which includes a patent license (the \"PATENTS-INCLUDED LICENSE\") by selecting pursuant to Part 6 of Exhibit A the patent terms in paragraphs A, B, C, D and E from Part 6 of Exhibit A, when the Initial Contributor distributes or makes available (as the case may be) such future copies under this License.\r\n\r\n(c) If any Recipient receives or obtains one or more copies of the Initial Work or any other portion of the Licensed Work under the Patents-Included License, then all licensing of such copies under this License shall include the terms in paragraphs A, B, C, D and E from Part 6 of Exhibit A and that Recipient shall not be able to rely upon the Patents-Excluded License for any such copies. However, all Recipients that receive one or more copies of the Initial Work or any other portion of the Licensed Work under a copy of the License which includes the Patents-Excluded License shall have no patent license with respect to such copies received under the Patents-Excluded License and availability and distribution of such copies, including Modifications made by such Recipient to such copies, shall be under a copy of the License without any patent license.\r\n\r\n(d) Where a Recipient uses in combination or combines any copy of the Licensed Work (or portion thereof) licensed under a copy of the License having a Patents-Excluded License with any copy of the Licensed Work (or portion thereof) licensed under a copy of the License having a Patents-Included License, the combination (and any portion thereof) shall, from the first time such Recipient uses, makes available or distributes the combination (as the case may be), be subject to only the terms of the License having the Patents-Included License which shall include the terms in paragraphs A, B, C, D and E from Part 6 of Exhibit A.\r\n\r\n2.3. ACKNOWLEDGEMENT AND DISCLAIMER.\r\n\r\nRecipient understands and agrees that although Initial Contributor and each Subsequent Contributor grants the licenses to its Contributions set forth herein, no representation, warranty, guarantee or assurance is provided by any Initial Contributor, Subsequent Contributor, or Distributor that the Licensed Work does not infringe the patent or other intellectual property rights of any other entity. Initial Contributor, Subsequent Contributor, and each Distributor disclaims any liability to Recipient for claims brought by any other entity based on infringement of intellectual property rights or otherwise, in relation to the Licensed Works. As a condition to exercising the rights and licenses granted hereunder, each Recipient hereby assumes sole responsibility to secure any other intellectual property rights needed, if any. For example, without limiting the foregoing disclaimers, if a third party patent license is required to allow Recipient to distribute the Licensed Work, it is Recipient's responsibility to acquire that license before distributing the Licensed Work.\r\n\r\n2.4. RESERVATION.\r\n\r\nNothing in this License shall be deemed to grant any rights to trademarks, copyrights, patents, trade secrets or any other intellectual property of Initial Contributor, Subsequent Contributor, or Distributor except as expressly stated herein.\r\n\r\n3. DISTRIBUTION OBLIGATIONS.\r\n\r\n3.1. DISTRIBUTION GENERALLY.\r\n\r\n(a) A Subsequent Contributor shall make that Subsequent Contributor's Subsequent Work(s) available to the public via an Electronic Distribution Mechanism for a period of at least twelve (12) months. The aforesaid twelve (12) month period shall begin within a reasonable time after the creation of the Subsequent Work and no later than sixty (60) days after first distribution of that Subsequent Contributor's Subsequent Work.\r\n\r\n(b) All Distributors must distribute the Licensed Work in accordance with the terms of the License, and must include a copy of this License (including without limitation Exhibit A and the accompanying Supplement File) with each copy of the Licensed Work distributed. In particular, this License must be prominently distributed with the Licensed Work in a file called \"license.txt.\" In addition, the License Notice in Part 5 of Exhibit A must be included at the beginning of all Source Code files, and viewable to a user in any executable such that the License Notice is reasonably brought to the attention of any party using the Licensed Work.\r\n\r\n3.2. EXECUTABLE DISTRIBUTIONS OF THE LICENSED WORK.\r\n\r\nA Distributor may choose to distribute the Licensed Work, or any portion thereof, in Executable form (an \"EXECUTABLE DISTRIBUTION\") to any third party, under the terms of Section 2 of this License, provided the Executable Distribution is made available under and accompanied by a copy of this License, AND provided at least ONE of the following conditions is fulfilled:\r\n\r\n(a) The Executable Distribution must be accompanied by the Source Code for the Licensed Work making up the Executable Distribution, and the Source Code must be distributed on the same media as the Executable Distribution or using an Electronic Distribution Mechanism; or\r\n\r\n(b) The Executable Distribution must be accompanied with a written offer, valid for at least thirty six (36) months, to give any third party under the terms of this License, for a charge no more than the cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete machine-readable copy of the Source Code for the Licensed Work making up the Executable Distribution, to be available and distributed using an Electronic Distribution Mechanism, and such Executable Distribution must remain available in Source Code form to any third party via the Electronic Distribution Mechanism (or any replacement Electronic Distribution Mechanism the particular Distributor may reasonably need to turn to as a substitute) for said at least thirty six (36) months.\r\n\r\nFor greater certainty, the above-noted requirements apply to any Licensed Work or portion thereof distributed to any third party in Executable form, whether such distribution is made alone, in combination with a Larger Work or Independent Modules, or in some other combination.\r\n\r\n3.3. SOURCE CODE DISTRIBUTIONS.\r\n\r\nWhen a Distributor makes the Licensed Work, or any portion thereof, available to any Person in Source Code form, it must be made available under this License and a copy of this License must be included with each copy of the Source Code, situated so that the copy of the License is conspicuously brought to the attention of that Person. For greater clarification, this Section 3.3 applies to all distribution of the Licensed Work in any Source Code form. A Distributor may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, which charge shall be no more than the cost of physically performing source distribution.\r\n\r\n3.4. REQUIRED NOTICES IN SOURCE CODE.\r\n\r\nEach Subsequent Contributor must ensure that the notice set out in Part 5 of Exhibit A is included in each file of the Source Code for each Subsequent Work originating from that particular Subsequent Contributor, if such notice is not already included in each such file. If it is not possible to put such notice in a particular Source Code file due to its structure, then the Subsequent Contributor must include such notice in a location (such as a relevant directory in which the file is stored) where a user would be likely to look for such a notice.\r\n\r\n3.5. NO DISTRIBUTION REQUIREMENTS FOR INTERNALLY USED MODIFICATIONS.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding Sections 3.2, 3.3 and 3.4, Recipient may, internally within its own corporation or organization use the Licensed Work, including the Initial Work and Subsequent Works, and make Modifications for internal use within Recipient's own corporation or organization (collectively, \"INTERNAL USE MODIFICATIONS\"). The Recipient shall have no obligation to distribute, in either Source Code or Executable form, any such Internal Use Modifications made by Recipient in the course of such internal use, except where required below in this Section 3.5. All Internal Use Modifications distributed to any Person, whether or not a Third Party, shall be distributed pursuant to and be accompanied by the terms of this License. If the Recipient chooses to distribute any such Internal Use Modifications to any Third Party, then the Recipient shall be deemed a Subsequent Contributor, and any such Internal Use Modifications distributed to any Third Party shall be deemed a Subsequent Work originating from that Subsequent Contributor, and shall from the first such instance become part of the Licensed Work that must thereafter be distributed and made available to third parties in accordance with the terms of Sections 3.1 to 3.4 inclusive.\r\n\r\n3.6. INDEPENDENT MODULES.\r\n\r\nThis License shall not apply to Independent Modules of any Initial Contributor, Subsequent Contributor, Distributor or any Recipient, and such Independent Modules may be licensed or made available under one or more separate license agreements.\r\n\r\n3.7. LARGER WORKS.\r\n\r\nAny Distributor or Recipient may create or contribute to a Larger Work by combining any of the Licensed Work with other code not governed by the terms of this License, and may distribute the Larger Work as one or more products. However, in any such case, Distributor or Recipient (as the case may be) must make sure that the requirements of this License are fulfilled for the Licensed Work portion of the Larger Work.\r\n\r\n3.8. DESCRIPTION OF DISTRIBUTED MODIFICATIONS.\r\n\r\n(a) Each Subsequent Contributor (including the Initial Contributor where the Initial Contributor also qualifies as a Subsequent Contributor) must cause each Subsequent Work created or contributed to by that Subsequent Contributor to contain a file documenting the changes, in accordance with the requirements of Part 1 of the Supplement File, that such Subsequent Contributor made in the creation or contribution to that Subsequent Work. If no Supplement File exists or no requirements are set out in Part 1 of the Supplement File, then there are no requirements for Subsequent Contributors to document changes that they make resulting in Subsequent Works.\r\n\r\n(b) The Initial Contributor may at any time introduce requirements or add to or change earlier requirements (in each case, the \"EARLIER DESCRIPTION REQUIREMENTS\") for documenting changes resulting in Subsequent Works by revising Part 1 of each copy of the Supplement File distributed by the Initial Contributor with future copies of the Licensed Work so that Part 1 then contains new requirements (the \"NEW DESCRIPTION REQUIREMENTS\") for documenting such changes.\r\n\r\n(c) Any Recipient receiving at any time any copy of an Initial Work or any Subsequent Work under a copy of this License (in each case, an \"Earlier LICENSED COPY\") having the Earlier Description Requirements may choose, with respect to each such Earlier Licensed Copy, to comply with the Earlier Description Requirements or the New Description Requirements. Where a Recipient chooses to comply with the New Description Requirements, that Recipient will, when thereafter distributing any copies of any such Earlier Licensed Copy, include a Supplement File having a section entitled Part 1 that contains a copy of the New Description Requirements.\r\n\r\n(d) For greater certainty, the intent of Part 1 of the Supplement File is to provide a mechanism (if any) by which Subsequent Contributors must document changes that they make to the Licensed Work resulting in Subsequent Works. Part 1 of any Supplement File shall not be used to increase or reduce the scope of the license granted in Article 2 of this License or in any other way increase or decrease the rights and obligations of any Recipient, and shall at no time serve as the basis for terminating the License. Further, a Recipient can be required to correct and change its documentation procedures to comply with Part 1 of the Supplement File, but cannot be penalised with damages. Part 1 of any Supplement File is only binding on each Recipient of any Licensed Work to the extent Part 1 sets out the requirements for documenting changes to the Initial Work or any Subsequent Work.\r\n\r\n(e) An example of a set of requirements for documenting changes and contributions made by Subsequent Contributor is set out in Part 7 of Exhibit A of this License. Part 7 is a sample only and is not binding on Recipients, unless (subject to the earlier paragraphs of this Section 3.8) those are the requirements that the Initial Contributor includes in Part 1 of the Supplement File with the copies of the Initial Work distributed under this License.\r\n\r\n3.9. USE OF DISTRIBUTOR NAME.\r\n\r\nThe name of a Distributor may not be used by any other Distributor to endorse or promote the Licensed Work or products derived from the Licensed Work, without prior written permission.\r\n\r\n3.10. LIMITED RECOGNITION OF INITIAL CONTRIBUTOR.\r\n\r\n(a) As a modest attribution to the Initial Contributor, in the hope that its promotional value may help justify the time, money and effort invested in writing the Initial Work, the Initial Contributor may include in Part 2 of the Supplement File a requirement that each time an executable program resulting from the Initial Work or any Subsequent Work, or a program dependent thereon, is launched or run, a prominent display of the Initial Contributor's attribution information must occur (the \"ATTRIBUTION INFORMATION\"). The Attribution Information must be included at the beginning of each Source Code file. For greater certainty, the Initial Contributor may specify in the Supplement File that the above attribution requirement only applies to an executable program resulting from the Initial Work or any Subsequent Work, but not a program dependent thereon. The intent is to provide for reasonably modest attribution, therefore the Initial Contributor may not require Recipients to display, at any time, more than the following Attribution Information: (a) a copyright notice including the name of the Initial Contributor; (b) a word or one phrase (not exceeding 10 words); (c) one digital image or graphic provided with the Initial Work; and (d) a URL (collectively, the \"ATTRIBUTION LIMITS\").\r\n\r\n(b) If no Supplement File exists, or no Attribution Information is set out in Part 2 of the Supplement File, then there are no requirements for Recipients to display any Attribution Information of the Initial Contributor.\r\n\r\n(c) Each Recipient acknowledges that all trademarks, service marks and/or trade names contained within Part 2 of the Supplement File distributed with the Licensed Work are the exclusive property of the Initial Contributor and may only be used with the permission of the Initial Contributor, or under circumstances otherwise permitted by law, or as expressly set out in this License.\r\n\r\n3.11. For greater certainty, any description or attribution provisions contained within a Supplement File may only be used to specify the nature of the description or attribution requirements, as the case may be. Any provision in a Supplement File that otherwise purports to modify, vary, nullify or amend any right, obligation or representation contained herein shall be deemed void to that extent, and shall be of no force or effect.\r\n\r\n4. COMMERCIAL USE AND INDEMNITY.\r\n\r\n4.1. COMMERCIAL SERVICES.\r\n\r\nA Recipient (\"COMMERCIAL RECIPIENT\") may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligations (collectively, \"SERVICES\") to one or more other Recipients or Distributors. However, such Commercial Recipient may do so only on that Commercial Recipient's own behalf, and not on behalf of any other Distributor or Recipient, and Commercial Recipient must make it clear than any such warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligation(s) is/are offered by Commercial Recipient alone. At no time may Commercial Recipient use any Services to deny any party the Licensed Work in Source Code or Executable form when so required under any of the other terms of this License. For greater certainty, this Section 4.1 does not diminish any of the other terms of this License, including without limitation the obligation of the Commercial Recipient as a Distributor, when distributing any of the Licensed Work in Source Code or Executable form, to make such distribution royalty-free (subject to the right to charge a fee of no more than the cost of physically performing Source Code or Executable distribution (as the case may be)).\r\n\r\n4.2. INDEMNITY.\r\n\r\nCommercial distributors of software may accept certain responsibilities with respect to end users, business partners and the like. While this License is intended to facilitate the commercial use of the Licensed Work, the Distributor who includes any of the Licensed Work in a commercial product offering should do so in a manner which does not create potential liability for other Distributors. Therefore, if a Distributor includes the Licensed Work in a commercial product offering or offers any Services, such Distributor (\"COMMERCIAL DISTRIBUTOR\") hereby agrees to defend and indemnify every other Distributor or Subsequent Contributor (in each case an \"INDEMNIFIED PARTY\") against any losses, damages and costs (collectively \"LOSSES\") arising from claims, lawsuits and other legal actions brought by a third party against the Indemnified Party to the extent caused by the acts or omissions of such Commercial Distributor in connection with its distribution of any of the Licensed Work in a commercial product offering or in connection with any Services. The obligations in this section do not apply to any claims or Losses relating to any actual or alleged intellectual property infringement. In order to qualify, an Indemnified Party must: (a) promptly notify the Commercial Distributor in writing of such claim; and (b) allow the Commercial Distributor to control, and co-operate with the Commercial Distributor in, the defense and any related settlement negotiations. The Indemnified Party may participate in any such claim at its own expense.\r\n\r\n5. VERSIONS OF THE LICENSE.\r\n\r\n5.1. NEW VERSIONS.\r\n\r\nThe Initial Contributor may publish revised and/or new versions of the License from time to time. Each version will be given a distinguishing version number.\r\n\r\n5.2. EFFECT OF NEW VERSIONS.\r\n\r\nOnce the Licensed Work or any portion thereof has been published by Initial Contributor under a particular version of the License, Recipient may choose to continue to use it under the terms of that version. However, if a Recipient chooses to use the Licensed Work under the terms of any subsequent version of the License published by the Initial Contributor, then from the date of making this choice, the Recipient must comply with the terms of that subsequent version with respect to all further reproduction, preparation of derivative works, public display of, public performance of, distribution and sublicensing by the Recipient in connection with the Licensed Work. No one other than the Initial Contributor has the right to modify the terms applicable to the Licensed Work\r\n\r\n6. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY.\r\n\r\n6.1. GENERAL DISCLAIMER.\r\n\r\nEXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS LICENSE, THE LICENSED WORK IS PROVIDED UNDER THIS LICENSE ON AN \"AS IS\" BASIS, WITHOUT ANY REPRESENTATION, WARRANTY, GUARANTEE, ASSURANCE OR CONDITION OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE LICENSED WORK IS WITH RECIPIENT. SHOULD ANY LICENSED WORK PROVE DEFECTIVE IN ANY RESPECT, RECIPIENT (NOT THE INITIAL CONTRIBUTOR OR ANY SUBSEQUENT CONTRIBUTOR) ASSUMES THE COST OF ANY NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION. THIS CLAUSE CONSTITUTES AN ESSENTIAL PART OF THIS LICENSE. NO USE OF ANY LICENSED WORK IS AUTHORIZED HEREUNDER EXCEPT UNDER THIS LICENSE INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION THIS DISCLAIMER.\r\n\r\n6.2. RESPONSIBILITY OF RECIPIENTS.\r\n\r\nEach Recipient is solely responsible for determining the appropriateness of using and distributing the Licensed Work and assumes all risks associated with its exercise of rights under this License, including but not limited to the risks and costs of program errors, compliance with applicable laws, damage to or loss of data, programs or equipment, and unavailability or interruption of operations.\r\n\r\n7. TERMINATION.\r\n\r\n7.1. This License shall continue until terminated in accordance with the express terms herein.\r\n\r\n7.2. Recipient may choose to terminate this License automatically at any time.\r\n\r\n7.3. This License, including without limitation the rights granted hereunder to a particular Recipient, will terminate automatically if such Recipient is in material breach of any of the terms of this License and fails to cure such breach within sixty (60) days of becoming aware of the breach. Without limiting the foregoing, any material breach by such Recipient of any term of any other License under which such Recipient is granted any rights to the Licensed Work shall constitute a material breach of this License.\r\n\r\n7.4. Upon termination of this License by or with respect to a particular Recipient for any reason, all rights granted hereunder and under any other License to that Recipient shall terminate. However, all sublicenses to the Licensed Work which were previously properly granted by such Recipient under a copy of this License (in each case, an \"Other License\" and in plural, \"Other Licenses\") shall survive any such termination of this License, including without limitation the rights and obligations under such Other Licenses as set out in their respective Sections 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 and 8, mutatis mutandis, for so long as the respective sublicensees (i.e. other Recipients) remain in compliance with the terms of the copy of this License under which such sublicensees received rights to the Licensed Work. Any termination of such Other Licenses shall be pursuant to their respective Section 7, mutatis mutandis. Provisions which, by their nature, must remain in effect beyond the termination of this License shall survive.\r\n\r\n7.5. Upon any termination of this License by or with respect to a particular Recipient, Sections 4.1, 4.2, 6.1, 6.2, 7.4, 7.5, 8.1, and 8.2, together with all provisions of this License necessary for the interpretation and enforcement of same, shall expressly survive such termination.\r\n\r\n8. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY.\r\n\r\n8.1. IN NO EVENT SHALL ANY OF INITIAL CONTRIBUTOR, ITS SUBSIDIARIES, OR AFFILIATES, OR ANY OF ITS OR THEIR RESPECTIVE OFFICERS, DIRECTORS, EMPLOYEES, AND/OR AGENTS (AS THE CASE MAY BE), HAVE ANY LIABILITY FOR ANY DIRECT DAMAGES, INDIRECT DAMAGES, PUNITIVE DAMAGES, INCIDENTAL DAMAGES, SPECIAL DAMAGES, EXEMPLARY DAMAGES, CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OR ANY OTHER DAMAGES WHATSOEVER (INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION LOSS OF USE, DATA OR PROFITS, OR ANY OTHER LOSS ARISING OUT OF OR IN ANY WAY RELATED TO THE USE, INABILITY TO USE, UNAUTHORIZED USE, PERFORMANCE, OR NON-PERFORMANCE OF THE LICENSED WORK OR ANY PART THEREOF OR THE PROVISION OF OR FAILURE TO PROVIDE SUPPORT SERVICES, OR THAT RESULT FROM ERRORS, DEFECTS, OMISSIONS, DELAYS IN OPERATION OR TRANSMISSION, OR ANY OTHER FAILURE OF PERFORMANCE), HOWEVER CAUSED AND ON ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY, WHETHER IN CONTRACT, STRICT LIABILITY, OR TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE OR OTHERWISE) IN RELATION TO OR ARISING IN ANY WAY OUT OF THIS LICENSE OR THE USE OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE LICENSED WORK OR THE EXERCISE OF ANY RIGHTS GRANTED HEREUNDER, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. THIS LIMITATION OF LIABILITY SHALL NOT APPLY TO LIABILITY FOR DEATH OR PERSONAL INJURY RESULTING FROM SUCH PARTY'S NEGLIGENCE TO THE EXTENT APPLICABLE LAW PROHIBITS SUCH LIMITATION. THIS CLAUSE CONSTITUTES AN ESSENTIAL PART OF THIS LICENSE. NO USE OF ANY LICENSED WORK IS AUTHORIZED HEREUNDER EXCEPT UNDER THIS LICENSE INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION THE LIMITATIONS SET FORTH IN THIS SECTION 8.1.\r\n\r\n8.2. EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS LICENSE, EACH RECIPIENT SHALL NOT HAVE ANY LIABILITY FOR ANY EXEMPLARY, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES (INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION LOST PROFITS), HOWEVER CAUSED AND ON ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY, WHETHER IN CONTRACT, STRICT LIABILITY, OR TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE OR OTHERWISE) ARISING IN ANY WAY OUT OF THE USE OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE LICENSED WORK OR THE EXERCISE OF ANY RIGHTS GRANTED HEREUNDER, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. THIS LIMITATION OF LIABILITY SHALL NOT APPLY TO LIABILITY FOR DEATH OR PERSONAL INJURY RESULTING FROM SUCH PARTY'S NEGLIGENCE TO THE EXTENT APPLICABLE LAW PROHIBITS SUCH LIMITATION.\r\n\r\n9. GOVERNING LAW AND LEGAL ACTION.\r\n\r\n9.1. This License shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the Governing Jurisdiction assigned in Part 3 of Exhibit A, without regard to its conflict of law provisions. No party may bring a legal action under this License more than one year after the cause of the action arose. Each party waives its rights (if any) to a jury trial in any litigation arising under this License. Note that if the Governing Jurisdiction is not assigned in Part 3 of Exhibit A, then the Governing Jurisdiction shall be the State of New York.\r\n\r\n9.2. The courts of the Governing Jurisdiction shall have jurisdiction, but not exclusive jurisdiction, to entertain and determine all disputes and claims, whether for specific performance, injunction, damages or otherwise, both at law and in equity, arising out of or in any way relating to this License, including without limitation, the legality, validity, existence and enforceability of this License. Each party to this License hereby irrevocably attorns to and accepts the jurisdiction of the courts of the Governing Jurisdiction for such purposes.\r\n\r\n9.3. Except as expressly set forth elsewhere herein, in the event of any action or proceeding brought by any party against another under this License the prevailing party shall be entitled to recover all costs and expenses including the fees of its attorneys in such action or proceeding in such amount as the court may adjudge reasonable.\r\n\r\n10. MISCELLANEOUS.\r\n\r\n10.1. The obligations imposed by this License are for the benefit of the Initial Contributor and any Recipient, and each Recipient acknowledges and agrees that the Initial Contributor and/or any other Recipient may enforce the terms and conditions of this License against any Recipient.\r\n\r\n10.2. This License represents the complete agreement concerning subject matter hereof, and supersedes and cancels all previous oral and written communications, representations, agreements and understandings between the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof.\r\n\r\n10.3. The application of the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods is expressly excluded.\r\n\r\n10.4. The language in all parts of this License shall be in all cases construed simply according to its fair meaning, and not strictly for or against any of the parties hereto. Any law or regulation which provides that the language of a contract shall be construed against the drafter shall not apply to this License.\r\n\r\n10.5. If any provision of this License is invalid or unenforceable under the laws of the Governing Jurisdiction, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of the remainder of the terms of this License, and without further action by the parties hereto, such provision shall be reformed to the minimum extent necessary to make such provision valid and enforceable.\r\n\r\n10.6.

The intent is that the Copyright Holder maintains some artistic control over the development of that Package while still keeping the Package available as open source and free software.\r\n\r\nYou are always permitted to make arrangements wholly outside of this license directly with the Copyright Holder of a given Package. If the terms of this license do not permit the full use that you propose to make of the Package, you should contact the Copyright Holder and seek a different licensing arrangement.\r\n\r\nDefinitions\r\n\"Copyright Holder\" means the individual(s) or organization(s) named in the copyright notice for the entire Package.\r\n\r\n\"Contributor\" means any party that has contributed code or other material to the Package, in accordance with the Copyright Holder's procedures.\r\n\r\n\"You\" and \"your\" means any person who would like to copy, distribute, or modify the Package.\r\n\r\n\"Package\" means the collection of files distributed by the Copyright Holder, and derivatives of that collection and/or of those files. A given Package may consist of either the Standard Version, or a Modified Version.\r\n\r\n\"Distribute\" means providing a copy of the Package or making it accessible to anyone else, or in the case of a company or organization, to others outside of your company or organization.\r\n\r\n\"Distributor Fee\" means any fee that you charge for Distributing this Package or providing support for this Package to another party. It does not mean licensing fees.\r\n\r\n\"Standard Version\" refers to the Package if it has not been modified, or has been modified only in ways explicitly requested by the Copyright Holder.\r\n\r\n\"Modified Version\" means the Package, if it has been changed, and such changes were not explicitly requested by the Copyright Holder.\r\n\r\n\"Original License\" means this Artistic License as Distributed with the Standard Version of the Package, in its current version or as it may be modified by The Perl Foundation in the future.\r\n\r\n\"Source\" form means the source code, documentation source, and configuration files for the Package.\r\n\r\n\"Compiled\" form means the compiled bytecode, object code, binary, or any other form resulting from mechanical transformation or translation of the Source form.\r\n\r\nPermission for Use and Modification Without Distribution\r\n(1) You are permitted to use the Standard Version and create and use Modified Versions for any purpose without restriction, provided that you do not Distribute the Modified Version.\r\n\r\nPermissions for Redistribution of the Standard Version\r\n(2) You may Distribute verbatim copies of the Source form of the Standard Version of this Package in any medium without restriction, either gratis or for a Distributor Fee, provided that you duplicate all of the original copyright notices and associated disclaimers. At your discretion, such verbatim copies may or may not include a Compiled form of the Package.\r\n\r\n(3) You may apply any bug fixes, portability changes, and other modifications made available from the Copyright Holder. The resulting Package will still be considered the Standard Version, and as such will be subject to the Original License.\r\n\r\nDistribution of Modified Versions of the Package as Source\r\n(4) You may Distribute your Modified Version as Source (either gratis or for a Distributor Fee, and with or without a Compiled form of the Modified Version) provided that you clearly document how it differs from the Standard Version, including, but not limited to, documenting any non-standard features, executables, or modules, and provided that you do at least ONE of the following:\r\n\r\n(a) make the Modified Version available to the Copyright Holder of the Standard Version, under the Original License, so that the Copyright Holder may include your modifications in the Standard Version.\r\n(b) ensure that installation of your Modified Version does not prevent the user installing or running the Standard Version. In addition, the Modified Version must bear a name that is different from the name of the Standard Version.\r\n(c) allow anyone who receives a copy of the Modified Version to make the Source form of the Modified Version available to others under\r\n(i) the Original License or\r\n(ii) a license that permits the licensee to freely copy, modify and redistribute the Modified Version using the same licensing terms that apply to the copy that the licensee received, and requires that the Source form of the Modified Version, and of any works derived from it, be made freely available in that license fees are prohibited but Distributor Fees are allowed.\r\n\r\nDistribution of Compiled Forms of the Standard Version or Modified Versions without the Source\r\n(5) You may Distribute Compiled forms of the Standard Version without the Source, provided that you include complete instructions on how to get the Source of the Standard Version. Such instructions must be valid at the time of your distribution. If these instructions, at any time while you are carrying out such distribution, become invalid, you must provide new instructions on demand or cease further distribution. If you provide valid instructions or cease distribution within thirty days after you become aware that the instructions are invalid, then you do not forfeit any of your rights under this license.\r\n\r\n(6) You may Distribute a Modified Version in Compiled form without the Source, provided that you comply with Section 4 with respect to the Source of the Modified Version.\r\n\r\nAggregating or Linking the Package\r\n(7) You may aggregate the Package (either the Standard Version or Modified Version) with other packages and Distribute the resulting aggregation provided that you do not charge a licensing fee for the Package. Distributor Fees are permitted, and licensing fees for other components in the aggregation are permitted. The terms of this license apply to the use and Distribution of the Standard or Modified Versions as included in the aggregation.\r\n\r\n(8) You are permitted to link Modified and Standard Versions with other works, to embed the Package in a larger work of your own, or to build stand-alone binary or bytecode versions of applications that include the Package, and Distribute the result without restriction, provided the result does not expose a direct interface to the Package.\r\n\r\nItems That are Not Considered Part of a Modified Version\r\n(9) Works (including, but not limited to, modules and scripts) that merely extend or make use of the Package, do not, by themselves, cause the Package to be a Modified Version. In addition, such works are not considered parts of the Package itself, and are not subject to the terms of this license.\r\n\r\nGeneral Provisions\r\n(10) Any use, modification, and distribution of the Standard or Modified Versions is governed by this Artistic License. By using, modifying or distributing the Package, you accept this license. Do not use, modify, or distribute the Package, if you do not accept this license.\r\n\r\n(11) If your Modified Version has been derived from a Modified Version made by someone other than you, you are nevertheless required to ensure that your Modified Version complies with the requirements of this license.\r\n\r\n(12) This license does not grant you the right to use any trademark, service mark, tradename, or logo of the Copyright Holder.\r\n\r\n(13) This license includes the non-exclusive, worldwide, free-of-charge patent license to make, have made, use, offer to sell, sell, import and otherwise transfer the Package with respect to any patent claims licensable by the Copyright Holder that are necessarily infringed by the Package. If you institute patent litigation (including a cross-claim or counterclaim) against any party alleging that the Package constitutes direct or contributory patent infringement, then this Artistic License to you shall terminate on the date that such litigation is filed.\r\n\r\n(14) Disclaimer of Warranty: THE PACKAGE IS PROVIDED BY THE COPYRIGHT HOLDER AND CONTRIBUTORS \"AS IS' AND WITHOUT ANY EXPRESS OR IMPLIED WARRANTIES.

The term \"Source Code\" means the preferred form of the Original Work for making modifications to it and all available documentation describing how to modify the Original Work. Licensor agrees to provide a machine-readable copy of the Source Code of the Original Work along with each copy of the Original Work that Licensor distributes. Licensor reserves the right to satisfy this obligation by placing a machine-readable copy of the Source Code in an information repository reasonably calculated to permit inexpensive and convenient access by You for as long as Licensor continues to distribute the Original Work.\r\n\r\n4) Exclusions From License Grant. Neither the names of Licensor, nor the names of any contributors to the Original Work, nor any of their trademarks or service marks, may be used to endorse or promote products derived from this Original Work without express prior permission of the Licensor. Except as expressly stated herein, nothing in this License grants any license to Licensor's trademarks, copyrights, patents, trade secrets or any other intellectual property.

The term \"External Deployment\" means the use, distribution, or communication of the Original Work or Derivative Works in any way such that the Original Work or Derivative Works may be used by anyone other than You, whether those works are distributed or communicated to those persons or made available as an application intended for use over a network. As an express condition for the grants of license hereunder, You must treat any External Deployment by You of the Original Work or a Derivative Work as a distribution under section 1(c).\r\n\r\n6) Attribution Rights. You must retain, in the Source Code of any Derivative Works that You create, all copyright, patent, or trademark notices from the Source Code of the Original Work, as well as any notices of licensing and any descriptive text identified therein as an \"Attribution Notice.\" You must cause the Source Code for any Derivative Works that You create to carry a prominent Attribution Notice reasonably calculated to inform recipients that You have modified the Original Work.\r\n\r\n7) Warranty of Provenance and Disclaimer of Warranty. Licensor warrants that the copyright in and to the Original Work and the patent rights granted herein by Licensor are owned by the Licensor or are sublicensed to You under the terms of this License with the permission of the contributor(s) of those copyrights and patent rights. Except as expressly stated in the immediately preceding sentence, the Original Work is provided under this License on an \"AS IS\" BASIS and WITHOUT WARRANTY, either express or implied, including, without limitation, the warranties of non-infringement, merchantability or fitness for a particular purpose.

This limitation of liability shall not apply to the extent applicable law prohibits such limitation.\r\n\r\n9) Acceptance and Termination. If, at any time, You expressly assented to this License, that assent indicates your clear and irrevocable acceptance of this License and all of its terms and conditions. If You distribute or communicate copies of the Original Work or a Derivative Work, You must make a reasonable effort under the circumstances to obtain the express assent of recipients to the terms of this License. This License conditions your rights to undertake the activities listed in Section 1, including your right to create Derivative Works based upon the Original Work, and doing so without honoring these terms and conditions is prohibited by copyright law and international treaty. Nothing in this License is intended to affect copyright exceptions and limitations (including \"fair use\" or \"fair dealing\"). This License shall terminate immediately and You may no longer exercise any of the rights granted to You by this License upon your failure to honor the conditions in Section 1(c).\r\n\r\n10) Termination for Patent Action. This License shall terminate automatically and You may no longer exercise any of the rights granted to You by this License as of the date You commence an action, including a cross-claim or counterclaim, against Licensor or any licensee alleging that the Original Work infringes a patent. This termination provision shall not apply for an action alleging patent infringement by combinations of the Original Work with other software or hardware.\r\n\r\n11) Jurisdiction, Venue and Governing Law. Any action or suit relating to this License may be brought only in the courts of a jurisdiction wherein the Licensor resides or in which Licensor conducts its primary business, and under the laws of that jurisdiction excluding its conflict-of-law provisions. The application of the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods is expressly excluded. Any use of the Original Work outside the scope of this License or after its termination shall be subject to the requirements and penalties of copyright or patent law in the appropriate jurisdiction. This section shall survive the termination of this License.\r\n\r\n12) Attorneys' Fees. In any action to enforce the terms of this License or seeking damages relating thereto, the prevailing party shall be entitled to recover its costs and expenses, including, without limitation, reasonable attorneys' fees and costs incurred in connection with such action, including any appeal of such action. This section shall survive the termination of this License.\r\n\r\n13) Miscellaneous. If any provision of this License is held to be unenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only to the extent necessary to make it enforceable.\r\n\r\n14) Definition of \"You\" in This License. \"You\" throughout this License, whether in upper or lower case, means an individual or a legal entity exercising rights under, and complying with all of the terms of, this License. For legal entities, \"You\" includes any entity that controls, is controlled by, or is under common control with you. For purposes of this definition, \"control\" means (i) the power, direct or indirect, to cause the direction or management of such entity, whether by contract or otherwise, or (ii) ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the outstanding shares, or (iii) beneficial ownership of such entity.\r\n\r\n15) Right to Use. You may use the Original Work in all ways not otherwise restricted or conditioned by this License or by law, and Licensor promises not to interfere with or be responsible for such uses by You.\r\n\r\n16) Modification of This License. This License is Copyright © 2005 Lawrence Rosen. Permission is granted to copy, distribute, or communicate this License without modification. Nothing in this License permits You to modify this License as applied to the Original Work or to Derivative Works. However, You may modify the text of this License and copy, distribute or communicate your modified version (the \"Modified License\") and apply it to other original works of authorship subject to the following conditions: (i) You may not indicate in any way that your Modified License is the \"Academic Free License\" or \"AFL\" and you may not use those names in the name of your Modified License; (ii) You must replace the notice specified in the first paragraph above with the notice \"Licensed under <insert your license name here>\" or with a notice of your own that is not confusingly similar to the notice in this License; and (iii) You may not claim that your original works are open source software unless your Modified License has been approved by Open Source Initiative (OSI) and You comply with its license review and certification process.", notes: nil, similar_license_id: nil},

GRANT OF RIGHTS\r\n\r\na. Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby grants Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free copyright license to reproduce, prepare derivative works of, publicly display, publicly perform, distribute and sublicense the Contribution of such Contributor, if any, and such derivative works, in source code and object code form. \r\nb. Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby grants Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free patent license under Licensed Patents to make, use, sell, offer to sell, import and otherwise transfer the Contribution of such Contributor, if any, in source code and object code form. The patent license granted by a Contributor shall also apply to the combination of the Contribution of that Contributor and the Program if, at the time the Contribution is added by the Contributor, such addition of the Contribution causes such combination to be covered by the Licensed Patents. The patent license granted by a Contributor shall not apply to (i) any other combinations which include the Contribution, nor to (ii) Contributions of other Contributors. No hardware per se is licensed hereunder. \r\nc. Recipient understands that although each Contributor grants the licenses to its Contributions set forth herein, no assurances are provided by any Contributor that the Program does not infringe the patent or other intellectual property rights of any other entity. Each Contributor disclaims any liability to Recipient for claims brought by any other entity based on infringement of intellectual property rights or otherwise. As a condition to exercising the rights and licenses granted hereunder, each Recipient hereby assumes sole responsibility to secure any other intellectual property rights needed, if any. For example, if a third party patent license is required to allow Recipient to distribute the Program, it is Recipient's responsibility to acquire that license before distributing the Program. \r\nd. Each Contributor represents that to its knowledge it has sufficient copyright rights in its Contribution, if any, to grant the copyright license set forth in this Agreement.\r\n\r\n3. REQUIREMENTS\r\n\r\nA. Distributor may choose to distribute the Program in any form under this Agreement or under its own license agreement, provided that:\r\n\r\nit complies with the terms and conditions of this Agreement;\r\nif the Program is distributed in source code or other tangible form, a copy of this Agreement or Distributor's own license agreement is included with each copy of the Program; and\r\nif distributed under Distributor's own license agreement, such license agreement:\r\neffectively disclaims on behalf of all Contributors all warranties and conditions, express and implied, including warranties or conditions of title and non-infringement, and implied warranties or conditions of merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose;\r\neffectively excludes on behalf of all Contributors all liability for damages, including direct, indirect, special, incidental and consequential damages, such as lost profits; and\r\nstates that any provisions which differ from this Agreement are offered by that Contributor alone and not by any other party.\r\nB. Each Distributor must include the following in a conspicuous location in the Program:\r\n\r\nCopyright (C) <YEAR>, <ORGANIZATION> and others. All Rights Reserved.\r\n\r\nC. In addition, each Contributor must identify itself as the originator of its Contribution in a manner that reasonably allows subsequent Recipients to identify the originator of the Contribution. Also, each Contributor must agree that the additions and/or changes are intended to be a Contribution. Once a Contribution is contributed, it may not thereafter be revoked.\r\n\r\n4. COMMERCIAL DISTRIBUTION\r\n\r\nCommercial distributors of software may accept certain responsibilities with respect to end users, business partners and the like. While this license is intended to facilitate the commercial use of the Program, the Distributor who includes the Program in a commercial product offering should do so in a manner which does not create potential liability for Contributors. Therefore, if a Distributor includes the Program in a commercial product offering, such Distributor (\"Commercial Distributor\") hereby agrees to defend and indemnify every Contributor (\"Indemnified Contributor\") against any losses, damages and costs (collectively \"Losses\") arising from claims, lawsuits and other legal actions brought by a third party against the Indemnified Contributor to the extent caused by the acts or omissions of such Commercial Distributor in connection with its distribution of the Program in a commercial product offering. The obligations in this section do not apply to any claims or Losses relating to any actual or alleged intellectual property infringement. In order to qualify, an Indemnified Contributor must: a) promptly notify the Commercial Distributor in writing of such claim, and b) allow the Commercial Distributor to control, and cooperate with the Commercial Distributor in, the defense and any related settlement negotiations. The Indemnified Contributor may participate in any such claim at its own expense.\r\n\r\nFor example, a Distributor might include the Program in a commercial product offering, Product X. That Distributor is then a Commercial Distributor. If that Commercial Distributor then makes performance claims, or offers warranties related to Product X, those performance claims and warranties are such Commercial Distributor's responsibility alone. Under this section, the Commercial Distributor would have to defend claims against the Contributors related to those performance claims and warranties, and if a court requires any Contributor to pay any damages as a result, the Commercial Distributor must pay those damages.\r\n\r\n5. NO WARRANTY\r\n\r\nEXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, THE PROGRAM IS PROVIDED ON AN \"AS IS\" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. Each Recipient is solely responsible for determining the appropriateness of using and distributing the Program and assumes all risks associated with its exercise of rights under this Agreement, including but not limited to the risks and costs of program errors, compliance with applicable laws, damage to or loss of data, programs or equipment, and unavailability or interruption of operations.\r\n\r\n6. DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY\r\n\r\nEXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, NEITHER RECIPIENT NOR ANY CONTRIBUTORS SHALL HAVE ANY LIABILITY FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES (INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION LOST PROFITS), HOWEVER CAUSED AND ON ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY, WHETHER IN CONTRACT, STRICT LIABILITY, OR TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE OR OTHERWISE) ARISING IN ANY WAY OUT OF THE USE OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM OR THE EXERCISE OF ANY RIGHTS GRANTED HEREUNDER, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.\r\n\r\n7. EXPORT CONTROL\r\n\r\nRecipient agrees that Recipient alone is responsible for compliance with the United States export administration regulations (and the export control laws and regulation of any other countries).\r\n\r\n8. GENERAL\r\n\r\nIf any provision of this Agreement is invalid or unenforceable under applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of the remainder of the terms of this Agreement, and without further action by the parties hereto, such provision shall be reformed to the minimum extent necessary to make such provision valid and enforceable.\r\n\r\nIf Recipient institutes patent litigation against a Contributor with respect to a patent applicable to software (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit), then any patent licenses granted by that Contributor to such Recipient under this Agreement shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed. In addition, if Recipient institutes patent litigation against any entity (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Program itself (excluding combinations of the Program with other software or hardware) infringes such Recipient's patent(s), then such Recipient's rights granted under Section 2(b) shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed.\r\n\r\nAll Recipient's rights under this Agreement shall terminate if it fails to comply with any of the material terms or conditions of this Agreement and does not cure such failure in a reasonable period of time after becoming aware of such noncompliance. If all Recipient's rights under this Agreement terminate, Recipient agrees to cease use and distribution of the Program as soon as reasonably practicable. However, Recipient's obligations under this Agreement and any licenses granted by Recipient relating to the Program shall continue and survive.\r\n\r\nLUCENT may publish new versions (including revisions) of this Agreement from time to time. Each new version of the Agreement will be given a distinguishing version number. The Program (including Contributions) may always be distributed subject to the version of the Agreement under which it was received. In addition, after a new version of the Agreement is published, Contributor may elect to distribute the Program (including its Contributions) under the new version. No one other than LUCENT has the right to modify this Agreement. Except as expressly stated in Sections 2(a) and 2(b) above, Recipient receives no rights or licenses to the intellectual property of any Contributor under this Agreement, whether expressly, by implication, estoppel or otherwise. All rights in the Program not expressly granted under this Agreement are reserved.\r\n\r\nThis Agreement is governed by the laws of the State of New York and the intellectual property laws of the United States of America. No party to this Agreement will bring a legal action under this Agreement more than one year after the cause of action arose. Each party waives its rights to a jury trial in any resulting litigation.", notes: nil, similar_license_id: nil},

THE ACCOMPANYING PROGRAM IS PROVIDED UNDER THE TERMS OF THIS COMPUTER ASSOCIATES TRUSTED OPEN SOURCE LICENSE (\"LICENSE\"). ANY USE, REPRODUCTION, MODIFICATION OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM CONSTITUTES THE RECIPIENT'S ACCEPTANCE OF THIS LICENSE.\r\nLicense Background\r\nComputer Associates International, Inc. (CA) believes in open source. We believe that the open source development approach can take appropriate software programs to unprecedented levels of quality, growth, and innovation. To demonstrate our continuing commitment to open source, we are releasing the Program (as defined below) under this License.\r\n\r\nThis License is intended to permit contributors and recipients of the Program to use the Program, including its source code, freely and without many of the concerns of some other open source licenses. Although we expect the underlying Program, and Contributions (as defined below) made to such Program, to remain open, this License is designed to permit you to maintain your own software programs free of this License unless you choose to do so. Thus, only your Contributions to the Program must be distributed under the terms of this License.\r\n\r\nThe provisions that follow set forth the terms and conditions under which you may use the Program.\r\n\r\n1. DEFINITIONS\r\n\r\n1.1 Contribution means (a) in the case of CA, the Original Program; and (b) in the case of each Contributor (including CA), changes and additions to the Program, where such changes and/or additions to the Program originate from and are distributed by that particular Contributor to unaffiliated third parties. A Contribution originates from a Contributor if it was added to the Program by such Contributor itself or anyone acting on such Contributors behalf. Contributions do not include additions to the Program which: (x) are separate modules of software distributed in conjunction with the Program under their own license agreement, and (y) are not derivative works of the Program.\r\n\r\n1.2 Contributor means CA and any other person or entity that distributes the Program.\r\n\r\n1.3 Contributor Version means as to a Contributor, that version of the Program that includes the Contributors Contribution but not any Contributions made to the Program thereafter.\r\n\r\n1.4 Larger Work means a work that combines the Program or portions thereof with code not governed by the terms of this License.\r\n\r\n1.5 Licensed Patents mean patents licensable by a Contributor that are infringed by the use or sale of its Contribution alone or when combined with the Program.\r\n\r\n1.6 Original Program means the original version of the software to which this License is attached and as released by CA, including source code, object code and documentation, if any.\r\n\r\n1.7 Program means the Original Program and Contributions.\r\n\r\n1.8 Recipient means anyone who modifies, copies, uses or distributes the Program.\r\n\r\n2. GRANT OF RIGHTS\r\n\r\n2.1 Subject to the terms of this License, each Contributor hereby grants Recipient an irrevocable, non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free license to reproduce, prepare derivative works of, publicly display, publicly perform, distribute and sublicense the Contribution of such Contributor, if any, and such derivative works, in source code and object code form. For the avoidance of doubt, the license provided in this Section 2.1 shall not include a license to any Licensed Patents of a Contributor.\r\n\r\n2.2 Subject to the terms of this License, each Contributor hereby grants Recipient an irrevocable, non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free license to the Licensed Patents to the extent necessary to make, use, sell, offer to sell and import the Contribution of such Contributor, if any, in source code and object code form. The license granted in this Section 2.2 shall apply to the combination of the Contribution and the Program if, at the time the Contribution is added by the Contributor, such addition of the Contribution causes the Licensed Patents to be infringed by such combination. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no license is granted under this Section 2.2: (a) for any code or works that do not include the Contributor Version, as it exists and is used in accordance with the terms hereof; (b) for infringements caused by: (i) third party modifications of the Contributor Version; or (ii) the combination of Contributions made by each such Contributor with other software (except as part of the Contributor Version) or other devices; or (c) with respect to Licensed Patents infringed by the Program in the absence of Contributions made by that Contributor.\r\n\r\n2.3 Recipient understands that although each Contributor grants the licenses to its Contributions set forth herein, except as provided in Section 2.4, no assurances are provided by any Contributor that the Program does not infringe the patent or other intellectual property rights of any other person or entity. Each Contributor disclaims any liability to Recipient for claims brought by any other person or entity based on infringement of intellectual property rights or otherwise. As a condition to exercising the rights and licenses granted hereunder, each Recipient hereby assumes sole responsibility to secure any other intellectual property rights needed, if any.\r\n\r\n2.4 Each Contributor represents and warrants that it has all right, title and interest in the copyrights in its Contributions, and has the right to grant the copyright licenses set forth in this License.\r\n\r\n3. DISTRIBUTION REQUIREMENTS\r\n\r\n3.1 If the Program is distributed in object code form, then a prominent notice must be included in the code itself as well as in any related documentation, stating that the source code for the Program is available from the Contributor with information on how and where to obtain the source code. A Contributor may choose to distribute the Program in object code form under its own license agreement, provided that:\r\n\r\nit complies with the terms and conditions of this License; and\r\nits license agreement:\r\neffectively disclaims on behalf of all Contributors all warranties and conditions, express and implied, including warranties or conditions of title and non-infringement, and implied warranties or conditions of merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose, to the maximum extent permitted by applicable law;\r\neffectively excludes on behalf of all Contributors all liability for damages, including direct, indirect, special, incidental and consequential damages, such as lost profits, to the maximum extent permitted by applicable law;\r\nstates that any provisions which are inconsistent with this License are offered by that Contributor alone and not by any other party; and\r\nstates that source code for the Program is available from such Contributor at the cost of distribution, and informs licensees how to obtain it in a reasonable manner.\r\n3.2 When the Program is made available in source code form:\r\n\r\nit must be made available under this License; and\r\na copy of this License must be included with each copy of the Program.\r\n3.3 This License is intended to facilitate the commercial distribution of the Program by any Contributor. However, Contributors may only charge Recipients a one-time, upfront fee for the distribution of the Program. Contributors may not charge Recipients any recurring charge, license fee, or any ongoing royalty for the Recipients exercise of its rights under this License to the Program. Contributors shall make the source code for the Contributor Version they distribute available at a cost, if any, equal to the cost to the Contributor to physically copy and distribute the work. It is not the intent of this License to prohibit a Contributor from charging fees for any service or maintenance that a Contributor may charge to a Recipient, so long as such fees are not an attempt to circumvent the foregoing restrictions on charging royalties or other recurring fees for the Program itself.\r\n\r\n3.4 A Contributor may create a Larger Work by combining the Program with other software code not governed by the terms of this License, and distribute the Larger Work as a single product. In such a case, the Contributor must make sure that the requirements of this License are fulfilled for the Program. Any Contributor who includes the Program in a commercial product offering, including as part of a Larger Work, may subject itself, but not any other Contributor, to additional contractual commitments, including, but not limited to, performance warranties and non-infringement representations on suchContributors behalf. No Contributor may create any additional liability for other Contributors. Therefore, if a Contributor includes the Program in a commercial product offering, such Contributor (Commercial Contributor) hereby agrees to defend and indemnify every other Contributor (Indemnified Contributor) who made Contributions to the Program distributed by the Commercial Contributor against any losses, damages and costs (collectively Losses) arising from claims, lawsuits and other legal actions brought by a third party against the Indemnified Contributor to the extent caused by the acts or omissions, including any additional contractual commitments, of such Commercial Contributor in connection with its distribution of the Program. The obligations in this section do not apply to any claims or Losses relating to any actual or alleged intellectual property infringement.\r\n\r\n3.5 If Contributor has knowledge that a license under a third partys intellectual property rights is required to exercise the rights granted by such Contributor under Sections 2.1 or 2.2, Contributor must (a) include a text file with the Program source code distribution titled ../IP_ISSUES, and (b) notify CA in writing at Computer Associates International, Inc., One Computer Associates Plaza, Islandia, New York 11749, Attn: Open Source Group or by email at opensource@ca.com, both describing the claim and the party making the claim in sufficient detail that a Recipient and CA will know whom to contact with regard to such matter. If Contributor obtains such knowledge after the Contribution is made available, Contributor shall also promptly modify the IP_ISSUES file in all copies Contributor makes available thereafter and shall take other steps (such as notifying appropriate mailing lists or newsgroups) reasonably calculated to inform those who received the Program that such new knowledge has been obtained.\r\n\r\n3.6 Recipient shall not remove, obscure, or modify any CA or other Contributor copyright or patent proprietary notices appearing in the Program, whether in the source code, object code or in any documentation. In addition to the obligations set forth in Section 4, each Contributor must identify itself as the originator of its Contribution, if any, in a manner that reasonably allows subsequent Recipients to identify the originator of the Contribution.\r\n\r\n4. CONTRIBUTION RESTRICTIONS\r\n\r\n4.1 Each Contributor must cause the Program to which the Contributor provides a Contribution to contain a file documenting the changes the Contributor made to create its version of the Program and the date of any change. Each Contributor must also include a prominent statement that the Contribution is derived, directly or indirectly, from the Program distributed by a prior Contributor, including the name of the prior Contributor from which such Contribution was derived, in (a) the Program source code, and (b) in any notice in an executable version or related documentation in which the Contributor describes the origin or ownership of the Program.\r\n\r\n5.

PATENT LITIGATION\r\n\r\n8.1 If Recipient institutes patent litigation against any person or entity (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Program itself (excluding combinations of the Program with other software or hardware) infringes such Recipients patent(s), then such Recipients rights granted under Section 2.2 shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed.\r\n\r\n9. OWNERSHIP\r\n\r\n9.1 Subject to the licenses granted under this License in Sections 2.1 and 2.2 above, each Contributor retains all rights, title and interest in and to any Contributions made by such Contributor. CA retains all rights, title and interest in and to the Original Program and any Contributions made by or on behalf of CA (CA Contributions), and such CA Contributions will not be automatically subject to this License. CA may, at its sole discretion, choose to license such CA Contributions under this License, or on different terms from those contained in this License or may choose not to license them at all.\r\n\r\n10. TERMINATION\r\n\r\n10.1 All of Recipients rights under this License shall terminate if it fails to comply with any of the material terms or conditions of this License and does not cure such failure in a reasonable period of time after becoming aware of such noncompliance. If Recipients rights under this License terminate, Recipient agrees to cease use and distribution of the Program as soon as reasonably practicable. However, Recipients obligations under this License and any licenses granted by Recipient as a Contributor relating to the Program shall continue and survive termination.\r\n\r\n11. GENERAL\r\n\r\n11.1 If any provision of this License is invalid or unenforceable under applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of the remainder of the terms of this License, and without further action by the parties hereto, such provision shall be reformed to the minimum extent necessary to make such provision valid and enforceable.\r\n\r\n11.2 CA may publish new versions (including revisions) of this License from time to time. Each new version of the License will be given a distinguishing version number. The Program (including Contributions) may always be distributed subject to the version of the License under which it was received. In addition, after a new version of the License is published, Contributor may elect to distribute the Program (including its Contributions) under the new version. No one other than CA has the right to modify this License.\r\n\r\n11.3 If it is impossible for Recipient to comply with any of the terms of this License with respect to some or all of the Program due to statute, judicial order, or regulation, then Recipient must: (a) comply with the terms of this License to the maximum extent possible; and (b) describe the limitations and the code they affect. Such description must be included in the IP_ISSUES file described in Section 3.5 and must be included with all distributions of the Program source code. Except to the extent prohibited by statute or regulation, such description must be sufficiently detailed for a Recipient of ordinary skill to be able to understand it.\r\n\r\n11.4 This License is governed by the laws of the State of New York. No Recipient will bring a legal action under this License more than one year after the cause of action arose. Each Recipient waives its rights to a jury trial in any resulting litigation. Any litigation or other dispute resolution between a Recipient and CA relating to this License shall take place in the State of New York, and Recipient and CA hereby consent to the personal jurisdiction of, and venue in, the state and federal courts within that district with respect to this License. The application of the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods is expressly excluded.\r\n\r\n11.5 Where Recipient is located in the province of Quebec, Canada, the following clause applies: The parties hereby confirm that they have requested that this License and all related documents be drafted in English.

The Source Code version of Covered Code may be distributed only under the terms of this License or a future version of this License released under Section 6.1, and You must include a copy of this License with every copy of the Source Code You distribute. You may not offer or impose any terms on any Source Code version that alters or restricts the applicable version of this License or the recipients' rights hereunder. However, You may include an additional document offering the additional rights described in Section 3.5.\r\n\r\n3.2. Availability of Source Code.

Required Notices. You must duplicate the notice in Exhibit A in each file of the Source Code. If it is not possible to put such notice in a particular Source Code file due to its structure, then You must include such notice in a location (such as a relevant directory) where a user would be likely to look for such a notice. If You created one or more Modification(s) You may add your name as a Contributor to the notice described in Exhibit A. You must also duplicate this License in any documentation for the Source Code where You describe recipients' rights or ownership rights relating to Covered Code. You may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligations to one or more recipients of Covered Code. However, You may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on behalf of the Initial Developer or any Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear than any such warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligation is offered by You alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify the Initial Developer and every Contributor for any liability incurred by the Initial Developer or such Contributor as a result of warranty, support, indemnity or liability terms You offer.\r\n\r\n3.6.

The notice must be conspicuously included in any notice in an Executable version, related documentation or collateral in which You describe recipients' rights relating to the Covered Code. You may distribute the Executable version of Covered Code or ownership rights under a license of Your choice, which may contain terms different from this License, provided that You are in compliance with the terms of this License and that the license for the Executable version does not attempt to limit or alter the recipient's rights in the Source Code version from the rights set forth in this License. If You distribute the Executable version under a different license You must make it absolutely clear that any terms which differ from this License are offered by You alone, not by the Initial Developer or any Contributor. You hereby agree to indemnify the Initial Developer and every Contributor for any liability incurred by the Initial Developer or such Contributor as a result of any such terms You offer.\r\n\r\n3.7. Larger Works. You may create a Larger Work by combining Covered Code with other code not governed by the terms of this License and distribute the Larger Work as a single product.

Each version will be given a distinguishing version number.\r\n\r\n6.2. Effect of New Versions. Once Covered Code has been published under a particular version of the License, You may always continue to use it under the terms of that version. You may also choose to use such Covered Code under the terms of any subsequent version of the License published by CUA Office Project. No one other than CUA Office Project has the right to modify the terms applicable to Covered Code created under this License.\r\n\r\n6.3. Derivative Works. If You create or use a modified version of this License (which you may only do in order to apply it to code which is not already Covered Code governed by this License), You must (a) rename Your license so that the phrases \"CUA Office\", \"CUA\", \"CUAPL\", or any confusingly similar phrase do not appear in your license (except to note that your license differs from this License) and (b) otherwise make it clear that Your version of the license contains terms which differ from the CUA Office Public License.

DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY.\r\n\r\nCOVERED CODE IS PROVIDED UNDER THIS LICENSE ON AN \"AS IS\" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES THAT THE COVERED CODE IS FREE OF DEFECTS, MERCHANTABLE, FIT FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR NON-INFRINGING. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE COVERED CODE IS WITH YOU. SHOULD ANY COVERED CODE PROVE DEFECTIVE IN ANY RESPECT, YOU (NOT THE INITIAL DEVELOPER OR ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR) ASSUME THE COST OF ANY NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION. THIS DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY CONSTITUTES AN ESSENTIAL PART OF THIS LICENSE. NO USE OF ANY COVERED CODE IS AUTHORIZED HEREUNDER EXCEPT UNDER THIS DISCLAIMER.\r\n\r\n8. TERMINATION.\r\n\r\n8.1. This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate automatically if You fail to comply with terms herein and fail to cure such breach within 30 days of becoming aware of the breach. All sublicenses to the Covered Code which are properly granted shall survive any termination of this License. Provisions which, by their nature, must remain in effect beyond the termination of this License shall survive.\r\n\r\n8.2. If You initiate litigation by asserting a patent infringement claim (excluding declatory judgment actions) against Initial Developer or a Contributor (the Initial Developer or Contributor against whom You file such action is referred to as \"Participant\") alleging that:\r\n\r\n(a) such Participant's Contributor Version directly or indirectly infringes any patent, then any and all rights granted by such Participant to You under Sections 2.1 and/or 2.2 of this License shall, upon 60 days notice from Participant terminate prospectively, unless if within 60 days after receipt of notice You either: (i) agree in writing to pay Participant a mutually agreeable reasonable royalty for Your past and future use of Modifications made by such Participant, or (ii) withdraw Your litigation claim with respect to the Contributor Version against such Participant. If within 60 days of notice, a reasonable royalty and payment arrangement are not mutually agreed upon in writing by the parties or the litigation claim is not withdrawn, the rights granted by Participant to You under Sections 2.1 and/or 2.2 automatically terminate at the expiration of the 60 day notice period specified above.\r\n\r\n(b) any software, hardware, or device, other than such Participant's Contributor Version, directly or indirectly infringes any patent, then any rights granted to You by such Participant under Sections 2.1(b) and 2.2(b) are revoked effective as of the date You first made, used, sold, distributed, or had made, Modifications made by that Participant.\r\n\r\n8.3. If You assert a patent infringement claim against Participant alleging that such Participant's Contributor Version directly or indirectly infringes any patent where such claim is resolved (such as by license or settlement) prior to the initiation of patent infringement litigation, then the reasonable value of the licenses granted by such Participant under Sections 2.1 or 2.2 shall be taken into account in determining the amount or value of any payment or license.\r\n\r\n8.4. In the event of termination under Sections 8.1 or 8.2 above, all end user license agreements (excluding distributors and resellers) which have been validly granted by You or any distributor hereunder prior to termination shall survive termination.\r\n\r\n9. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY.\r\n\r\nUNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES AND UNDER NO LEGAL THEORY, WHETHER TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), CONTRACT, OR OTHERWISE, SHALL YOU, THE INITIAL DEVELOPER, ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR, OR ANY DISTRIBUTOR OF COVERED CODE, OR ANY SUPPLIER OF ANY OF SUCH PARTIES, BE LIABLE TO ANY PERSON FOR ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY CHARACTER INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF GOODWILL, WORK STOPPAGE, COMPUTER FAILURE OR MALFUNCTION, OR ANY AND ALL OTHER COMMERCIAL DAMAGES OR LOSSES, EVEN IF SUCH PARTY SHALL HAVE BEEN INFORMED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. THIS LIMITATION OF LIABILITY SHALL NOT APPLY TO LIABILITY FOR DEATH OR PERSONAL INJURY RESULTING FROM SUCH PARTY'S NEGLIGENCE TO THE EXTENT APPLICABLE LAW PROHIBITS SUCH LIMITATION. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO THIS EXCLUSION AND LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.\r\n\r\n10. U.S. GOVERNMENT END USERS.\r\n\r\nThe Covered Code is a \"commercial item,\" as that term is defined in 48 C.F.R. 2.101 (Oct. 1995), consisting of \"commercial computer software\" and \"commercial computer software documentation,\" as such terms are used in 48 C.F.R. 12.212 (Sept. 1995). Consistent with 48 C.F.R. 12.212 and 48 C.F.R. 227.7202-1 through 227.7202-4 (June 1995), all U.S. Government End Users acquire Covered Code with only those rights set forth herein.\r\n\r\n11. MISCELLANEOUS.\r\n\r\nThis License represents the complete agreement concerning subject matter hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be unenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only to the extent necessary to make it enforceable. This License shall be governed by California law provisions (except to the extent applicable law, if any, provides otherwise), excluding its conflict-of-law provisions. With respect to disputes in which at least one party is a citizen of, or an entity chartered or registered to do business in the United States of America, any litigation relating to this License shall be subject to the jurisdiction of the Federal Courts of the Northern District of California, with venue lying in Santa Clara County, California, with the losing party responsible for costs, including without limitation, court costs and reasonable attorneys' fees and expenses. The application of the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods is expressly excluded. Any law or regulation which provides that the language of a contract shall be construed against the drafter shall not apply to this License.\r\n\r\n12. RESPONSIBILITY FOR CLAIMS.\r\n\r\nAs between Initial Developer and the Contributors, each party is responsible for claims and damages arising, directly or indirectly, out of its utilization of rights under this License and You agree to work with Initial Developer and Contributors to distribute such responsibility on an equitable basis. Nothing herein is intended or shall be deemed to constitute any admission of liability.\r\n\r\n13. MULTIPLE-LICENSED CODE.\r\n\r\nInitial Developer may designate portions of the Covered Code as \"Multiple-Licensed\". \"Multiple-Licensed\" means that the Initial Developer permits you to utilize portions of the Covered Code under Your choice of the NPL or the alternative licenses, if any, specified by the Initial Developer in the file described in Exhibit A.\r\n\r\nEXHIBIT A - CUA Office Public License.\r\n\r\n``The contents of this file are subject to the CUA Office Public License Version 1.0 (the \"License\"); you may not use this file except in compliance with the License.

License Conditions. The grant of the License under Section 1 hereof, and your exercise of all rights in connection with this License Agreement, will remain subject to the following terms and conditions, as well as to the other provisions hereof:\r\n\r\n(a)     Complete Source Code for any Downstream Distribution directly or indirectly made by You that contains, or depends for its intended functionality on, the Frameworx Code Base, or any portion or element thereof, shall be made freely available to all users thereof on terms and conditions no more restrictive, and no less favorable for any user (including, without limitation, with regard to Source Code availability and royalty-free use) than those terms and conditions provided in this License Agreement.\r\n\r\n(b)     Any Value-Added Services that you offer or provide, directly or indirectly, in relation to any Downstream Distribution shall be offered and provided on commercial terms that are reasonably commensurate to the fair market value of such Value-Added Services. In addition, the terms and conditions on which any such Value Added Services are so offered or provided shall be consistent with, and shall fully support, the intent and purpose of this License Agreement.\r\n\r\n(c)     All Downstream Distributions shall:\r\n\r\n                               (i)            include all portions and elements of the Frameworx Code Base required to build the Source Code of such Downstream Distribution into a fully functional machine-executable system, or additional build scripts or comparable software necessary and sufficient for such purposes;\r\n\r\n                             (ii)            include, in each file containing any portion or element of the Frameworx Code Base, the following identifying legend: This file contains software that has been made available under The Frameworx Open License 1.0. Use and distribution hereof are subject to the restrictions set forth therein.\r\n\r\n                            (iii)            include all other copyright notices, authorship credits, warranty disclaimers (including that provided in Section 6 below), legends, documentation, annotations and comments contained in the Frameworx Code Base as provided to You hereunder;\r\n\r\n                            (iv)            contain an unaltered copy of the html file named frameworx_community_invitation.html included within the Frameworx Code Base that acknowledges new users and provides them with information on the Frameworx Code Base community;\r\n\r\n                              (v)            contain an unaltered copy of the text file named the_frameworx_license.txt included within the Frameworx Code Base that includes a text copy of the form of this License Agreement; and\r\n\r\n                            (vi)            prominently display to any viewer or user of the Source Code of such Open Downstream Distribution, in the place and manner normally used for such displays, the following legend:\r\n\r\nSource code licensed under from The Frameworx Company is contained herein, and such source code has been obtained either under The Frameworx Open License, or another license granted by The Frameworx Company.

A copy of The Frameworx Open License is provided in a file named the_frameworx_license.txt and included herein, and may also be available for inspection at http://www.frameworx.com.\r\n\r\n4. Restrictions on Open Downstream Distributions. Each Downstream Distribution made by You, and by any party directly or indirectly obtaining rights to the Frameworx Code Base through You, shall be made subject to a license grant or agreement to the extent necessary so that each distributee under that Downstream Distribution will be subject to the same restrictions on re-distribution and use as are binding on You hereunder. You may satisfy this licensing requirement either by:\r\n\r\n(a)     requiring as a condition to any Downstream Distribution made by you, or by any direct or indirect distributee of Your Downstream Distribution (or any portion or element thereof), that each distributee under the relevant Downstream Distribution obtain a direct license (on the same terms and conditions as those in this License Agreement) from The Frameworx Company; or\r\n\r\n(b)     sub-licensing all (and not less than all) of Your rights and obligations hereunder to that distributee, including (without limitation) Your obligation to require distributees to be bound by license restrictions as contemplated by this Section 4 above.\r\n\r\nThe Frameworx Company hereby grants to you all rights to sub-license your rights hereunder as necessary to fully effect the intent and purpose of this Section 4 above, provided, however, that your rights and obligations hereunder shall be unaffected by any such sublicensing. In addition, The Frameworx Company expressly retains all rights to take all appropriate action (including legal action) against any such direct or indirect sub-licensee to ensure its full compliance with the intent and purposes of this License Agreement.\r\n\r\n5. Intellectual Property. Except as expressly provided herein, this License Agreement preserves and respects Your and The Frameworx Companys respective intellectual property rights, including, in the case of The Frameworx Company, its copyrights and patent rights relating to the Frameworx Code Base.\r\n\r\n6.

License Violation. The License, and all of your rights thereunder, shall be deemed automatically terminated and void as of any Downstream Distribution directly or indirectly made or facilitated by You that violates the provisions of this License Agreement, provided, however, that this License Agreement shall survive any such termination in order to remedy the effects of such violation. This License Agreement shall be binding on the legal successors and assigns of the parties hereto.\r\n\r\nYour agreement to the foregoing as of the date hereof has been evidenced by your acceptance of the relevant software distribution hereunder.\r\n\r\n(C) THE FRAMEWORX COMPANY 2003", notes: nil, similar_license_id: nil},

ANY USE, REPRODUCTION OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM CONSTITUTES RECIPIENT'S ACCEPTANCE OF THIS AGREEMENT.\r\n1. DEFINITIONS\r\n\"Contribution\" means:\r\n\r\nin the case of International Business Machines Corporation (\"IBM\"), the Original Program, and\r\nin the case of each Contributor,\r\nchanges to the Program, and\r\nadditions to the Program;\r\nwhere such changes and/or additions to the Program originate from and are distributed by that particular Contributor. A Contribution 'originates' from a Contributor if it was added to the Program by such Contributor itself or anyone acting on such Contributor's behalf. Contributions do not include additions to the Program which: (i) are separate modules of software distributed in conjunction with the Program under their own license agreement, and (ii) are not derivative works of the Program.\r\n\"Contributor\" means IBM and any other entity that distributes the Program.\r\n\r\n\"Licensed Patents \" mean patent claims licensable by a Contributor which are necessarily infringed by the use or sale of its Contribution alone or when combined with the Program.\r\n\r\n\"Original Program\" means the original version of the software accompanying this Agreement as released by IBM, including source code, object code and documentation, if any.\r\n\r\n\"Program\" means the Original Program and Contributions.\r\n\r\n\"Recipient\" means anyone who receives the Program under this Agreement, including all Contributors.\r\n\r\n2. GRANT OF RIGHTS\r\nSubject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby grants Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free copyright license to reproduce, prepare derivative works of, publicly display, publicly perform, distribute and sublicense the Contribution of such Contributor, if any, and such derivative works, in source code and object code form.\r\nSubject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby grants Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free patent license under Licensed Patents to make, use, sell, offer to sell, import and otherwise transfer the Contribution of such Contributor, if any, in source code and object code form. This patent license shall apply to the combination of the Contribution and the Program if, at the time the Contribution is added by the Contributor, such addition of the Contribution causes such combination to be covered by the Licensed Patents. The patent license shall not apply to any other combinations which include the Contribution. No hardware per se is licensed hereunder.\r\nRecipient understands that although each Contributor grants the licenses to its Contributions set forth herein, no assurances are provided by any Contributor that the Program does not infringe the patent or other intellectual property rights of any other entity. Each Contributor disclaims any liability to Recipient for claims brought by any other entity based on infringement of intellectual property rights or otherwise. As a condition to exercising the rights and licenses granted hereunder, each Recipient hereby assumes sole responsibility to secure any other intellectual property rights needed, if any. For example, if a third party patent license is required to allow Recipient to distribute the Program, it is Recipient's responsibility to acquire that license before distributing the Program.\r\nEach Contributor represents that to its knowledge it has sufficient copyright rights in its Contribution, if any, to grant the copyright license set forth in this Agreement.\r\n3. REQUIREMENTS\r\nA Contributor may choose to distribute the Program in object code form under its own license agreement, provided that:\r\nit complies with the terms and conditions of this Agreement; and\r\nits license agreement:\r\neffectively disclaims on behalf of all Contributors all warranties and conditions, express and implied, including warranties or conditions of title and non-infringement, and implied warranties or conditions of merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose;\r\neffectively excludes on behalf of all Contributors all liability for damages, including direct, indirect, special, incidental and consequential damages, such as lost profits;\r\nstates that any provisions which differ from this Agreement are offered by that Contributor alone and not by any other party; and\r\nstates that source code for the Program is available from such Contributor, and informs licensees how to obtain it in a reasonable manner on or through a medium customarily used for software exchange.\r\nWhen the Program is made available in source code form:\r\nit must be made available under this Agreement; and\r\na copy of this Agreement must be included with each copy of the Program.\r\nEach Contributor must include the following in a conspicuous location in the Program:\r\nCopyright (C) 1996, 1999 International Business Machines Corporation and others. All Rights Reserved.\r\nIn addition, each Contributor must identify itself as the originator of its Contribution, if any, in a manner that reasonably allows subsequent Recipients to identify the originator of the Contribution.\r\n\r\n4. COMMERCIAL DISTRIBUTION\r\nCommercial distributors of software may accept certain responsibilities with respect to end users, business partners and the like. While this license is intended to facilitate the commercial use of the Program, the Contributor who includes the Program in a commercial product offering should do so in a manner which does not create potential liability for other Contributors. Therefore, if a Contributor includes the Program in a commercial product offering, such Contributor (\"Commercial Contributor\") hereby agrees to defend and indemnify every other Contributor (\"Indemnified Contributor\") against any losses, damages and costs (collectively \"Losses\") arising from claims, lawsuits and other legal actions brought by a third party against the Indemnified Contributor to the extent caused by the acts or omissions of such Commercial Contributor in connection with its distribution of the Program in a commercial product offering. The obligations in this section do not apply to any claims or Losses relating to any actual or alleged intellectual property infringement. In order to qualify, an Indemnified Contributor must: a) promptly notify the Commercial Contributor in writing of such claim, and b) allow the Commercial Contributor to control, and cooperate with the Commercial Contributor in, the defense and any related settlement negotiations. The Indemnified Contributor may participate in any such claim at its own expense.\r\n\r\nFor example, a Contributor might include the Program in a commercial product offering, Product X. That Contributor is then a Commercial Contributor. If that Commercial Contributor then makes performance claims, or offers warranties related to Product X, those performance claims and warranties are such Commercial Contributor's responsibility alone. Under this section, the Commercial Contributor would have to defend claims against the other Contributors related to those performance claims and warranties, and if a court requires any other Contributor to pay any damages as a result, the Commercial Contributor must pay those damages.\r\n\r\n5. NO WARRANTY\r\nEXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, THE PROGRAM IS PROVIDED ON AN \"AS IS\" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. Each Recipient is solely responsible for determining the appropriateness of using and distributing the Program and assumes all risks associated with its exercise of rights under this Agreement, including but not limited to the risks and costs of program errors, compliance with applicable laws, damage to or loss of data, programs or equipment, and unavailability or interruption of operations.\r\n6. DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY\r\nEXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, NEITHER RECIPIENT NOR ANY CONTRIBUTORS SHALL HAVE ANY LIABILITY FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES (INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION LOST PROFITS), HOWEVER CAUSED AND ON ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY, WHETHER IN CONTRACT, STRICT LIABILITY, OR TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE OR OTHERWISE) ARISING IN ANY WAY OUT OF THE USE OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM OR THE EXERCISE OF ANY RIGHTS GRANTED HEREUNDER, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.\r\n7. GENERAL\r\nIf any provision of this Agreement is invalid or unenforceable under applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of the remainder of the terms of this Agreement, and without further action by the parties hereto, such provision shall be reformed to the minimum extent necessary to make such provision valid and enforceable.\r\nIf Recipient institutes patent litigation against a Contributor with respect to a patent applicable to software (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit), then any patent licenses granted by that Contributor to such Recipient under this Agreement shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed. In addition, if Recipient institutes patent litigation against any entity (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Program itself (excluding combinations of the Program with other software or hardware) infringes such Recipient's patent(s), then such Recipient's rights granted under Section 2(b) shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed.\r\n\r\nAll Recipient's rights under this Agreement shall terminate if it fails to comply with any of the material terms or conditions of this Agreement and does not cure such failure in a reasonable period of time after becoming aware of such noncompliance. If all Recipient's rights under this Agreement terminate, Recipient agrees to cease use and distribution of the Program as soon as reasonably practicable. However, Recipient's obligations under this Agreement and any licenses granted by Recipient relating to the Program shall continue and survive.\r\n\r\nIBM may publish new versions (including revisions) of this Agreement from time to time. Each new version of the Agreement will be given a distinguishing version number. The Program (including Contributions) may always be distributed subject to the version of the Agreement under which it was received. In addition, after a new version of the Agreement is published, Contributor may elect to distribute the Program (including its Contributions) under the new version. No one other than IBM has the right to modify this Agreement. Except as expressly stated in Sections 2(a) and 2(b) above, Recipient receives no rights or licenses to the intellectual property of any Contributor under this Agreement, whether expressly, by implication, estoppel or otherwise. All rights in the Program not expressly granted under this Agreement are reserved.\r\n\r\nThis Agreement is governed by the laws of the State of New York and the intellectual property laws of the United States of America. No party to this Agreement will bring a legal action under this Agreement more than one year after the cause of action arose. Each party waives its rights to a jury trial in any resulting litigation.", notes: "", similar_license_id: 8},

This license may be particularly suitable if your work is TeX-related (such as a LaTeX package), but it is written in such a way that you can use it even if your work is unrelated to TeX.\r\n\r\nThe section `WHETHER AND HOW TO DISTRIBUTE WORKS UNDER THIS LICENSE', below, gives instructions, examples, and recommendations for authors who are considering distributing their works under this license.\r\n\r\nThis license gives conditions under which a work may be distributed and modified, as well as conditions under which modified versions of that work may be distributed.\r\n\r\nWe, the LaTeX3 Project, believe that the conditions below give you the freedom to make and distribute modified versions of your work that conform with whatever technical specifications you wish while maintaining the availability, integrity, and reliability of that work. If you do not see how to achieve your goal while meeting these conditions, then read the document `cfgguide.tex' and `modguide.tex' in the base LaTeX distribution for suggestions.\r\n\r\nDEFINITIONS\r\nIn this license document the following terms are used:\r\n\r\n`Work'\r\nAny work being distributed under this License.\r\n`Derived Work'\r\nAny work that under any applicable law is derived from the Work.\r\n`Modification'\r\nAny procedure that produces a Derived Work under any applicable law — for example, the production of a file containing an original file associated with the Work or a significant portion of such a file, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another language.\r\n`Modify'\r\nTo apply any procedure that produces a Derived Work under any applicable law.\r\n`Distribution'\r\nMaking copies of the Work available from one person to another, in whole or in part. Distribution includes (but is not limited to) making any electronic components of the Work accessible by file transfer protocols such as FTP or HTTP or by shared file systems such as Sun's Network File System (NFS).\r\n`Compiled Work'\r\nA version of the Work that has been processed into a form where it is directly usable on a computer system. This processing may include using installation facilities provided by the Work, transformations of the Work, copying of components of the Work, or other activities. Note that modification of any installation facilities provided by the Work constitutes modification of the Work.\r\n`Current Maintainer'\r\nA person or persons nominated as such within the Work. If there is no such explicit nomination then it is the `Copyright Holder' under any applicable law.\r\n`Base Interpreter'\r\nA program or process that is normally needed for running or interpreting a part or the whole of the Work. \r\n\r\nA Base Interpreter may depend on external components but these are not considered part of the Base Interpreter provided that each external component clearly identifies itself whenever it is used interactively. Unless explicitly specified when applying the license to the Work, the only applicable Base Interpreter is a `LaTeX-Format' or in the case of files belonging to the `LaTeX-format' a program implementing the `TeX language'.\r\nCONDITIONS ON DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION\r\nActivities other than distribution and/or modification of the Work are not covered by this license; they are outside its scope. In particular, the act of running the Work is not restricted and no requirements are made concerning any offers of support for the Work.\r\nYou may distribute a complete, unmodified copy of the Work as you received it. Distribution of only part of the Work is considered modification of the Work, and no right to distribute such a Derived Work may be assumed under the terms of this clause.\r\nYou may distribute a Compiled Work that has been generated from a complete, unmodified copy of the Work as distributed under Clause 2 above, as long as that Compiled Work is distributed in such a way that the recipients may install the Compiled Work on their system exactly as it would have been installed if they generated a Compiled Work directly from the Work.\r\nIf you are the Current Maintainer of the Work, you may, without restriction, modify the Work, thus creating a Derived Work. You may also distribute the Derived Work without restriction, including Compiled Works generated from the Derived Work. Derived Works distributed in this manner by the Current Maintainer are considered to be updated versions of the Work.\r\nIf you are not the Current Maintainer of the Work, you may modify your copy of the Work, thus creating a Derived Work based on the Work, and compile this Derived Work, thus creating a Compiled Work based on the Derived Work.\r\nIf you are not the Current Maintainer of the Work, you may distribute a Derived Work provided the following conditions are met for every component of the Work unless that component clearly states in the copyright notice that it is exempt from that condition. Only the Current Maintainer is allowed to add such statements of exemption to a component of the Work.\r\nIf a component of this Derived Work can be a direct replacement for a component of the Work when that component is used with the Base Interpreter, then, wherever this component of the Work identifies itself to the user when used interactively with that Base Interpreter, the replacement component of this Derived Work clearly and unambiguously identifies itself as a modified version of this component to the user when used interactively with that Base Interpreter.\r\nEvery component of the Derived Work contains prominent notices detailing the nature of the changes to that component, or a prominent reference to another file that is distributed as part of the Derived Work and that contains a complete and accurate log of the changes.\r\nNo information in the Derived Work implies that any persons, including (but not limited to) the authors of the original version of the Work, provide any support, including (but not limited to) the reporting and handling of errors, to recipients of the Derived Work unless those persons have stated explicitly that they do provide such support for the Derived Work.\r\nYou distribute at least one of the following with the Derived Work:\r\nA complete, unmodified copy of the Work; if your distribution of a modified component is made by offering access to copy the modified component from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the Work from the same or some similar place meets this condition, even though third parties are not compelled to copy the Work along with the modified component;\r\nInformation that is sufficient to obtain a complete, unmodified copy of the Work.\r\nIf you are not the Current Maintainer of the Work, you may distribute a Compiled Work generated from a Derived Work, as long as the Derived Work is distributed to all recipients of the Compiled Work, and as long as the conditions of Clause 6, above, are met with regard to the Derived Work.\r\nThe conditions above are not intended to prohibit, and hence do not apply to, the modification, by any method, of any component so that it becomes identical to an updated version of that component of the Work as it is distributed by the Current Maintainer under Clause 4, above.\r\nDistribution of the Work or any Derived Work in an alternative format, where the Work or that Derived Work (in whole or in part) is then produced by applying some process to that format, does not relax or nullify any sections of this license as they pertain to the results of applying that process.\r\nA Derived Work may be distributed under a different license provided that license itself honors the conditions listed in Clause 6 above, in regard to the Work, though it does not have to honor the rest of the conditions in this license.\r\nIf a Derived Work is distributed under a different license, that Derived Work must provide sufficient documentation as part of itself to allow each recipient of that Derived Work to honor the restrictions in Clause 6 above, concerning changes from the Work.\r\nThis license places no restrictions on works that are unrelated to the Work, nor does this license place any restrictions on aggregating such works with the Work by any means.\r\nNothing in this license is intended to, or may be used to, prevent complete compliance by all parties with all applicable laws.\r\nNO WARRANTY\r\nThere is no warranty for the Work. Except when otherwise stated in writing, the Copyright Holder provides the Work `as is', without warranty of any kind, either expressed or implied, including, but not limited to, the implied warranties of merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose. The entire risk as to the quality and performance of the Work is with you. Should the Work prove defective, you assume the cost of all necessary servicing, repair, or correction.\r\n\r\nIn no event unless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing will The Copyright Holder, or any author named in the components of the Work, or any other party who may distribute and/or modify the Work as permitted above, be liable to you for damages, including any general, special, incidental or consequential damages arising out of any use of the Work or out of inability to use the Work (including, but not limited to, loss of data, data being rendered inaccurate, or losses sustained by anyone as a result of any failure of the Work to operate with any other programs), even if the Copyright Holder or said author or said other party has been advised of the possibility of such damages.\r\n\r\nMAINTENANCE OF THE WORK\r\nThe Work has the status `author-maintained' if the Copyright Holder explicitly and prominently states near the primary copyright notice in the Work that the Work can only be maintained by the Copyright Holder or simply that it is `author-maintained'.\r\n\r\nThe Work has the status `maintained' if there is a Current Maintainer who has indicated in the Work that they are willing to receive error reports for the Work (for example, by supplying a valid e-mail address). It is not required for the Current Maintainer to acknowledge or act upon these error reports.\r\n\r\nThe Work changes from status `maintained' to `unmaintained' if there is no Current Maintainer, or the person stated to be Current Maintainer of the work cannot be reached through the indicated means of communication for a period of six months, and there are no other significant signs of active maintenance.\r\n\r\nYou can become the Current Maintainer of the Work by agreement with any existing Current Maintainer to take over this role.\r\n\r\nIf the Work is unmaintained, you can become the Current Maintainer of the Work through the following steps:\r\n\r\nMake a reasonable attempt to trace the Current Maintainer (and the Copyright Holder, if the two differ) through the means of an Internet or similar search.\r\nIf this search is successful, then enquire whether the Work is still maintained.\r\nIf it is being maintained, then ask the Current Maintainer to update their communication data within one month.\r\nIf the search is unsuccessful or no action to resume active maintenance is taken by the Current Maintainer, then announce within the pertinent community your intention to take over maintenance. (If the Work is a LaTeX work, this could be done, for example, by posting to comp.text.tex.)\r\nIf the Current Maintainer is reachable and agrees to pass maintenance of the Work to you, then this takes effect immediately upon announcement.\r\nIf the Current Maintainer is not reachable and the Copyright Holder agrees that maintenance of the Work be passed to you, then this takes effect immediately upon announcement.\r\nIf you make an `intention announcement' as described in 2b. above and after three months your intention is challenged neither by the Current Maintainer nor by the Copyright Holder nor by other people, then you may arrange for the Work to be changed so as to name you as the (new) Current Maintainer.\r\nIf the previously unreachable Current Maintainer becomes reachable once more within three months of a change completed under the terms of 3b) or 4), then that Current Maintainer must become or remain the Current Maintainer upon request provided they then update their communication data within one month.\r\nA change in the Current Maintainer does not, of itself, alter the fact that the Work is distributed under the LPPL license.\r\n\r\nIf you become the Current Maintainer of the Work, you should immediately provide, within the Work, a prominent and unambiguous statement of your status as Current Maintainer. You should also announce your new status to the same pertinent community as in 2b) above.\r\n\r\nWHETHER AND HOW TO DISTRIBUTE WORKS UNDER THIS LICENSE\r\nThis section contains important instructions, examples, and recommendations for authors who are considering distributing their works under this license. These authors are addressed as `you' in this section.\r\n\r\nChoosing This License or Another License\r\nIf for any part of your work you want or need to use *distribution* conditions that differ significantly from those in this license, then do not refer to this license anywhere in your work but, instead, distribute your work under a different license. You may use the text of this license as a model for your own license, but your license should not refer to the LPPL or otherwise give the impression that your work is distributed under the LPPL.\r\n\r\nThe document `modguide.tex' in the base LaTeX distribution explains the motivation behind the conditions of this license. It explains, for example, why distributing LaTeX under the GNU General Public License (GPL) was considered inappropriate. Even if your work is unrelated to LaTeX, the discussion in `modguide.tex' may still be relevant, and authors intending to distribute their works under any license are encouraged to read it.\r\n\r\nA Recommendation on Modification Without Distribution\r\nIt is wise never to modify a component of the Work, even for your own personal use, without also meeting the above conditions for distributing the modified component. While you might intend that such modifications will never be distributed, often this will happen by accident — you may forget that you have modified that component; or it may not occur to you when allowing others to access the modified version that you are thus distributing it and violating the conditions of this license in ways that could have legal implications and, worse, cause problems for the community. It is therefore usually in your best interest to keep your copy of the Work identical with the public one. Many works provide ways to control the behavior of that work without altering any of its licensed components.\r\n\r\nHow to Use This License\r\nTo use this license, place in each of the components of your work both an explicit copyright notice including your name and the year the work was authored and/or last substantially modified. Include also a statement that the distribution and/or modification of that component is constrained by the conditions in this license.\r\n\r\nHere is an example of such a notice and statement:\r\n\r\n  %% pig.dtx\r\n  %% Copyright 2005 M. Y. Name\r\n  %\r\n  % This work may be distributed and/or modified under the\r\n  % conditions of the LaTeX Project Public License, either version 1.3\r\n  % of this license or (at your option) any later version.\r\n  % The latest version of this license is in\r\n  %   http://www.latex-project.org/lppl.txt\r\n  % and version 1.3 or later is part of all distributions of LaTeX\r\n  % version 2005/12/01 or later.\r\n  %\r\n  % This work has the LPPL maintenance status `maintained'.\r\n  % \r\n  % The Current Maintainer of this work is M. Y. Name.\r\n  %\r\n  % This work consists of the files pig.dtx and pig.ins\r\n  % and the derived file pig.sty.\r\nGiven such a notice and statement in a file, the conditions given in this license document would apply, with the `Work' referring to the three files `pig.dtx', `pig.ins', and `pig.sty' (the last being generated from `pig.dtx' using `pig.ins'), the `Base Interpreter' referring to any `LaTeX-Format', and both `Copyright Holder' and `Current Maintainer' referring to the person `M. Y. Name'.\r\n\r\nIf you do not want the Maintenance section of LPPL to apply to your Work, change `maintained' above into `author-maintained'. However, we recommend that you use `maintained', as the Maintenance section was added in order to ensure that your Work remains useful to the community even when you can no longer maintain and support it yourself.\r\n\r\nDerived Works That Are Not Replacements\r\nSeveral clauses of the LPPL specify means to provide reliability and stability for the user community. They therefore concern themselves with the case that a Derived Work is intended to be used as a (compatible or incompatible) replacement of the original Work. If this is not the case (e.g., if a few lines of code are reused for a completely different task), then clauses 6b and 6d shall not apply.\r\n\r\nImportant Recommendations\r\nDefining What Constitutes the Work\r\nThe LPPL requires that distributions of the Work contain all the files of the Work. It is therefore important that you provide a way for the licensee to determine which files constitute the Work. This could, for example, be achieved by explicitly listing all the files of the Work near the copyright notice of each file or by using a line such as:\r\n\r\n    % This work consists of all files listed in manifest.txt.\r\nin that place. In the absence of an unequivocal list it might be impossible for the licensee to determine what is considered by you to comprise the Work and, in such a case, the licensee would be entitled to make reasonable conjectures as to which files comprise the Work.", notes: nil, similar_license_id: nil},

(\"Licensor\"). Any Motosoto Product licensed pursuant to this License is a \"Licensed Product.\" Licensed Product, in its entirety, is protected by Dutch copyright law. This License identifies the terms under which you may use, copy, distribute or modify Licensed Product and has been submitted to the Open Software Initiative (OSI) for approval.\r\n\r\nPreamble\r\n\r\nThis Preamble is intended to describe, in plain English, the nature and scope of this License. However, this Preamble is not a part of this license. The legal effect of this License is dependent only upon the terms of the License and not this Preamble. This License complies with the Open Source Definition and has been approved by Open Source Initiative. Software distributed under this License may be marked as \"OSI Certified Open Source Software.\"\r\n\r\nThis License provides that:\r\n\r\n1. You may use, sell or give away the Licensed Product, alone or as a component of an aggregate software distribution containing programs from several different sources. No royalty or other fee is required.\r\n\r\n2. Both Source Code and executable versions of the Licensed Product, including Modifications made by previous Contributors, are available for your use. (The terms \"Licensed Product,\" \"Modifications,\" \"Contributors\" and \"Source Code\" are defined in the License.)\r\n\r\n3. You are allowed to make Modifications to the Licensed Product, and you can create Derivative Works from it. (The term \"Derivative Works\" is defined in the License.)\r\n\r\n4. By accepting the Licensed Product under the provisions of this License, you agree that any Modifications you make to the Licensed Product and then distribute are governed by the provisions of this License. In particular, you must make the Source Code of your Modifications available to others.\r\n\r\n5. You may use the Licensed Product for any purpose, but the Licensor is not providing you any warranty whatsoever, nor is the Licensor accepting any liability in the event that the Licensed Product doesn't work properly or causes you any injury or damages.\r\n\r\n6. If you sublicense the Licensed Product or Derivative Works, you may charge fees for warranty or support, or for accepting indemnity or liability obligations to your customers. You cannot charge for the Source Code.\r\n\r\n7. If you assert any patent claims against the Licensor relating to the Licensed Product, or if you breach any terms of the License, your rights to the Licensed Product under this License automatically terminate.\r\n\r\nYou may use this License to distribute your own Derivative Works, in which case the provisions of this License will apply to your Derivative Works just as they do to the original Licensed Product.\r\n\r\nAlternatively, you may distribute your Derivative Works under any other OSI-approved Open Source license, or under a proprietary license of your choice. If you use any license other than this License, however, you must continue to fulfill the requirements of this License (including the provisions relating to publishing the Source Code) for those portions of your Derivative Works that consist of the Licensed Product, including the files containing Modifications.\r\n\r\nNew versions of this License may be published from time to time. You may choose to continue to use the license terms in this version of the License or those from the new version. However, only the Licensor has the right to change the License terms as they apply to the Licensed Product. This License relies on precise definitions for certain terms. Those terms are defined when they are first used, and the definitions are repeated for your convenience in a Glossary at the end of the License.\r\n\r\nLicense Terms\r\n\r\n1. Grant of License From Licensor.\r\n\r\nLicensor hereby grants you a world-wide, royalty-free, non-exclusive license, subject to third party intellectual property claims, to do the following:\r\n\r\na. Use, reproduce, modify, display, perform, sublicense and distribute Licensed Product or portions thereof (including Modifications as hereinafter defined), in both Source Code or as an executable program. \"Source Code\" means the preferred form for making modifications to the Licensed Product, including all modules contained therein, plus any associated interface definition files, scripts used to control compilation and installation of an executable program, or a list of differential comparisons against the Source Code of the Licensed Product.\r\n\r\nb. Create Derivative Works (as that term is defined under Dutch copyright law) of Licensed Product by adding to or deleting from the substance or structure of said Licensed Product.\r\n\r\nc. Under claims of patents now or hereafter owned or controlled by Licensor, to make, use, sell, offer for sale, have made, and/or otherwise dispose of Licensed Product or portions thereof, but solely to the extent that any such claim is necessary to enable you to make, use, sell, offer for sale, have made, and/or otherwise dispose of Licensed Product or portions thereof or Derivative Works thereof.\r\n\r\n2. Grant of License to Modifications From Contributor.\r\n\r\n\"Modifications\" means any additions to or deletions from the substance or structure of (i) a file containing Licensed Product, or (ii) any new file that contains any part of Licensed Product. Hereinafter in this License, the term \"Licensed Product\" shall include all previous Modifications that you receive from any Contributor. By application of the provisions in Section 4(a) below, each person or entity who created or contributed to the creation of, and distributed, a Modification (a \"Contributor\") hereby grants you a world-wide, royalty-free, non-exclusive license, subject to third party intellectual property claims, to do the following:\r\n\r\na. Use, reproduce, modify, display, perform, sublicense and distribute any Modifications created by such Contributor or portions thereof, in both Source Code or as an executable program, either on an unmodified basis or as part of Derivative Works.\r\n\r\nb. Under claims of patents now or hereafter owned or controlled by Contributor, to make, use, sell, offer for sale, have made, and/or otherwise dispose of Modifications or portions thereof, but solely to the extent that any such claim is necessary to enable you to make, use, sell, offer for sale, have made, and/or otherwise dispose of Modifications or portions thereof or Derivative Works thereof.\r\n\r\n3. Exclusions From License Grant.\r\n\r\nNothing in this License shall be deemed to grant any rights to trademarks, copyrights, patents, trade secrets or any other intellectual property of Licensor or any Contributor except as expressly stated herein. No patent license is granted separate from the Licensed Product, for code that you delete from the Licensed Product, or for combinations of the Licensed Product with other software or hardware. No right is granted to the trademarks of Licensor or any Contributor even if such marks are included in the Licensed Product. Nothing in this License shall be interpreted to prohibit Licensor from licensing under different terms from this License any code that Licensor otherwise would have a right to license.\r\n\r\n4. Your Obligations Regarding Distribution.\r\n\r\na. Application of This License to Your Modifications. As an express condition for your use of the Licensed Product, you hereby agree that any Modifications that you create or to which you contribute, and which you distribute, are governed by the terms of this License including, without limitation, Section 2. Any Modifications that you create or to which you contribute may be distributed only under the terms of this License or a future version of this License released under Section 7. You must include a copy of this License with every copy of the Modifications you distribute. You agree not to offer or impose any terms on any Source Code or executable version of the Licensed Product or Modifications that alter or restrict the applicable version of this License or the recipients' rights hereunder. However, you may include an additional document offering the additional rights described in Section 4(e).\r\n\r\nb. Availability of Source Code. You must make available, under the terms of this License, the Source Code of the Licensed Product and any Modifications that you distribute, either on the same media as you distribute any executable or other form of the Licensed Product, or via a mechanism generally accepted in the software development community for the electronic transfer of data (an \"Electronic Distribution Mechanism\"). The Source Code for any version of Licensed Product or Modifications that you distribute must remain available for at least twelve (12) months after the date it initially became available, or at least six (6) months after a subsequent version of said Licensed Product or Modifications has been made available. You are responsible for ensuring that the Source Code version remains available even if the Electronic Distribution Mechanism is maintained by a third party.\r\n\r\nc. Description of Modifications. You must cause any Modifications that you create or to which you contribute, and which you distribute, to contain a file documenting the additions, changes or deletions you made to create or contribute to those Modifications, and the dates of any such additions, changes or deletions. You must include a prominent statement that the Modifications are derived, directly or indirectly, from the Licensed Product and include the names of the Licensor and any Contributor to the Licensed Product in (i) the Source Code and (ii) in any notice displayed by a version of the Licensed Product you distribute or in related documentation in which you describe the origin or ownership of the Licensed Product. You may not modify or delete any preexisting copyright notices in the Licensed Product.\r\n\r\nd. Intellectual Property Matters.\r\n\r\ni. Third Party Claims. If you have knowledge that a license to a third party's intellectual property right is required to exercise the rights granted by this License, you must include a text file with the Source Code distribution titled \"LEGAL\" that describes the claim and the party making the claim in sufficient detail that a recipient will know whom to contact. If you obtain such knowledge after you make any Modifications available as described in Section 4(b), you shall promptly modify the LEGAL file in all copies you make available thereafter and shall take other steps (such as notifying appropriate mailing lists or newsgroups) reasonably calculated to inform those who received the Licensed Product from you that new knowledge has been obtained.\r\n\r\nii. Contributor APIs. If your Modifications include an application programming interface (\"API\") and you have knowledge of patent licenses that are reasonably necessary to implement that API, you must also include this information in the LEGAL file.\r\n\r\niii. Representations. You represent that, except as disclosed pursuant to 4(d)(i) above, you believe that any Modifications you distribute are your original creations and that you have sufficient rights to grant the rights conveyed by this License.\r\n\r\ne. Required Notices. You must duplicate this License in any documentation you provide along with the Source Code of any Modifications you create or to which you contribute, and which you distribute, wherever you describe recipients' rights relating to Licensed Product. You must duplicate the notice contained in Exhibit A (the \"Notice\") in each file of the Source Code of any copy you distribute of the Licensed Product. If you created a Modification, you may add your name as a Contributor to the Notice. If it is not possible to put the Notice in a particular Source Code file due to its structure, then you must include such Notice in a location (such as a relevant directory file) where a user would be likely to look for such a notice. You may choose to offer, and charge a fee for, warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligations to one or more recipients of Licensed Product. However, you may do so only on your own behalf, and not on behalf of the Licensor or any Contributor. You must make it clear that any such warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligation is offered by you alone, and you hereby agree to indemnify the Licensor and every Contributor for any liability incurred by the Licensor or such Contributor as a result of warranty, support, indemnity or liability terms you offer.\r\n\r\nf. Distribution of Executable Versions. You may distribute Licensed Product as an executable program under a license of your choice that may contain terms different from this License provided (i) you have satisfied the requirements of Sections 4(a) through 4(e) for that distribution, (ii) you include a conspicuous notice in the executable version, related documentation and collateral materials stating that the Source Code version of the Licensed Product is available under the terms of this License, including a description of how and where you have fulfilled the obligations of Section 4(b), (iii) you retain all existing copyright notices in the Licensed Product, and (iv) you make it clear that any terms that differ from this License are offered by you alone, not by Licensor or any Contributor. You hereby agree to indemnify the Licensor and every Contributor for any liability incurred by Licensor or such Contributor as a result of any terms you offer.\r\n\r\ng. Distribution of Derivative Works. You may create Derivative Works (e.g., combinations of some or all of the Licensed Product with other code) and distribute the Derivative Works as products under any other license you select, with the proviso that the requirements of this License are fulfilled for those portions of the Derivative Works that consist of the Licensed Product or any Modifications thereto.\r\n\r\n5. Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation.\r\n\r\nIf it is impossible for you to comply with any of the terms of this License with respect to some or all of the Licensed Product due to statute, judicial order, or regulation, then you must (i) comply with the terms of this License to the maximum extent possible, (ii) cite the statute or regulation that prohibits you from adhering to the License, and (iii) describe the limitations and the code they affect. Such description must be included in the LEGAL file described in Section 4(d), and must be included with all distributions of the Source Code. Except to the extent prohibited by statute or regulation, such description must be sufficiently detailed for a recipient of ordinary skill at computer programming to be able to understand it.\r\n\r\n6. Application of This License.\r\n\r\nThis License applies to code to which Licensor or Contributor has attached the Notice in Exhibit A, which is incorporated herein by this reference.\r\n\r\n7. Versions of This License.\r\n\r\na. Version. The Motosoto Open Source License is derived from the Jabber Open Source License. All changes are related to applicable law and the location of court.\r\n\r\nb. New Versions. Licensor may publish from time to time revised and/or new versions of the License.\r\n\r\nc. Effect of New Versions. Once Licensed Product has been published under a particular version of the License, you may always continue to use it under the terms of that version. You may also choose to use such Licensed Product under the terms of any subsequent version of the License published by Licensor. No one other than Lic ensor has the right to modify the terms applicable to Licensed Product created under this License.\r\n\r\nd. Derivative Works of this License. If you create or use a modified version of this License, which you may do only in order to apply it to software that is not already a Licensed Product under this License, you must rename your license so that it is not confusingly similar to this License, and must make it clear that your license contains terms that differ from this License. In so naming your license, you may not use any trademark of Licensor or any Contributor.\r\n\r\n8. Disclaimer of Warranty.\r\n\r\nLICENSED PRODUCT IS PROVIDED UNDER THIS LICENSE ON AN \"AS IS\" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES THAT THE LICENSED PRODUCT IS FREE OF DEFECTS, MERCHANTABLE, FIT FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR NON-INFRINGING. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE LICENSED PRODUCT IS WITH YOU. SHOULD LICENSED PRODUCT PROVE DEFECTIVE IN ANY RESPECT, YOU (AND NOT THE LICENSOR OR ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR) ASSUME THE COST OF ANY NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION. THIS DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY CONSTITUTES AN ESSENTIAL PART OF THIS LICENSE. NO USE OF LICENSED PRODUCT IS AUTHORIZED HEREUNDER EXCEPT UNDER THIS DISCLAIMER.\r\n\r\n9. Termination.\r\n\r\na. Automatic Termination Upon Breach. This license and the rights granted hereunder will terminate automatically if you fail to comply with the terms herein and fail to cure such breach within thirty (30) days of becoming aware of the breach. All sublicenses to the Licensed Product that are properly granted shall survive any termination of this license. Provisions that, by their nature, must remain in effect beyond the termination of this License, shall survive.\r\n\r\nb. Termination Upon Assertion of Patent Infringement. If you initiate litigation by asserting a patent infringement claim (excluding declaratory judgment actions) against Licensor or a Contributor (Licensor or Contributor against whom you file such an action is referred to herein as \"Respondent\") alleging that Licensed Product directly or indirectly infringes any patent, then any and all rights granted by such Respondent to you under Sections 1 or 2 of this License shall terminate prospectively upon sixty (60) days notice from Respondent (the \"Notice Period\") unless within that Notice Period you either agree in writing (i) to pay Respondent a mutually agreeable reasonably royalty for your past or future use of Licensed Product made by such Respondent, or (ii) withdraw your litigation claim with respect to Licensed Product against such Respondent. If within said Notice Period a reasonable royalty and payment arrangement are not mutually agreed upon in writing by the parties or the litigation claim is not withdrawn, the rights granted by Licensor to you under Sections 1 and 2 automatically terminate at the expiration of said Notice Period.\r\n\r\nc. Reasonable Value of This License. If you assert a patent infringement claim against Respondent alleging that Licensed Product directly or indirectly infringes any patent where such claim is resolved (such as by license or settlement) prior to the initiation of patent infringement litigation, then the reasonable value of the licenses granted by said Respondent under Sections 1 and 2 shall be taken into account in determining the amount or value of any payment or license.\r\n\r\nd. No Retroactive Effect of Termination. In the event of termination under Sections 9(a) or 9(b) above, all end user license agreements (excluding licenses to distributors and reselle rs) that have been validly granted by you or any distributor hereunder prior to termination shall survive termination.\r\n\r\n10. Limitation of Liability.\r\n\r\nUNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES AND UNDER NO LEGAL THEORY, WHETHER TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), CONTRACT, OR OTHERWISE, SHALL THE LICENSOR, ANY CONTRIBUTOR, OR ANY DISTRIBUTOR OF LICENSED PRODUCT, OR ANY SUPPLIER OF ANY OF SUCH PARTIES, BE LIABLE TO ANY PERSON FOR ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY CHARACTER INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF GOODWILL, WORK STOPPAGE, COMPUTER FAILURE OR MALFUNCTION, OR ANY AND ALL OTHER COMMERCIAL DAMAGES OR LOSSES, EVEN IF SUCH PARTY SHALL HAVE BEEN INFORMED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. THIS LIMITATION OF LIABILITY SHALL NOT APPLY TO LIABILITY FOR DEATH OR PERSONAL INJURY RESULTING FROM SUCH PARTY\r\n", notes: nil, similar_license_id: nil},

Stephenson \r\n(Based on the BISON general public license, copyright 1988 Richard M. Stallman)\r\nEveryone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this license, but changing it is not allowed. You can also use this wording to make the terms for other programs.\r\nThe license agreements of most software companies keep you at the mercy of those companies. By contrast, our general public license is intended to give everyone the right to share NetHack. To make sure that you get the rights we want you to have, we need to make restrictions that forbid anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights. Hence this license agreement.\r\n\r\nSpecifically, we want to make sure that you have the right to give away copies of NetHack, that you receive source code or else can get it if you want it, that you can change NetHack or use pieces of it in new free programs, and that you know you can do these things.\r\n\r\nTo make sure that everyone has such rights, we have to forbid you to deprive anyone else of these rights. For example, if you distribute copies of NetHack, you must give the recipients all the rights that you have. You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code. And you must tell them their rights.\r\n\r\nAlso, for our own protection, we must make certain that everyone finds out that there is no warranty for NetHack. If NetHack is modified by someone else and passed on, we want its recipients to know that what they have is not what we distributed.\r\n\r\nTherefore we (Mike Stephenson and other holders of NetHack copyrights) make the following terms which say what you must do to be allowed to distribute or change NetHack.\r\n\r\nCOPYING POLICIES\r\nYou may copy and distribute verbatim copies of NetHack source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you keep intact the notices on all files that refer to copyrights, to this License Agreement, and to the absence of any warranty; and give any other recipients of the NetHack program a copy of this License Agreement along with the program.\r\nYou may modify your copy or copies of NetHack or any portion of it, and copy and distribute such modifications under the terms of Paragraph 1 above (including distributing this License Agreement), provided that you also do the following:\r\na) cause the modified files to carry prominent notices stating that you changed the files and the date of any change; and\r\n\r\nb) cause the whole of any work that you distribute or publish, that in whole or in part contains or is a derivative of NetHack or any part thereof, to be licensed at no charge to all third parties on terms identical to those contained in this License Agreement (except that you may choose to grant more extensive warranty protection to some or all third parties, at your option)\r\n\r\nc) You may charge a distribution fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.\r\n\r\nYou may copy and distribute NetHack (or a portion or derivative of it, under Paragraph 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of Paragraphs 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:\r\na) accompany it with the complete machine-readable source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Paragraphs 1 and 2 above; or,\r\n\r\nb) accompany it with full information as to how to obtain the complete machine-readable source code from an appropriate archive site. (This alternative is allowed only for noncommercial distribution.)\r\n\r\nFor these purposes, complete source code means either the full source distribution as originally released over Usenet or updated copies of the files in this distribution used to create the object code or executable.\r\n\r\nYou may not copy, sublicense, distribute or transfer NetHack except as expressly provided under this License Agreement. Any attempt otherwise to copy, sublicense, distribute or transfer NetHack is void and your rights to use the program under this License agreement shall be automatically terminated. However, parties who have received computer software programs from you with this License Agreement will not have their licenses terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.\r\nStated plainly: You are permitted to modify NetHack, or otherwise use parts of NetHack, provided that you comply with the conditions specified above; in particular, your modified NetHack or program containing parts of NetHack must remain freely available as provided in this License Agreement. In other words, go ahead and share NetHack, but don't try to stop anyone else from sharing it farther.", notes: nil, similar_license_id: nil},

DISTRIBUTION OBLIGATIONS. \r\n3.1 Application of License. \r\nThe Modifications which You create or to which You contribute are governed by the terms of this License, including without limitation Section 2.2. The Source Code version of Covered Software may be distributed only under the terms of this License or a future version of this License released under Section 6.1, and You must include a copy of this License with every copy of the Source Code You distribute. You may not offer or impose any terms on any Source Code version that alters or restricts the applicable version of this License or the recipients' rights hereunder. However, You may include an additional document offering the additional rights described in Section 3.5.\r\n\r\n3.2 Availability of Source Code. \r\nAny Modification which You create or to which You contribute must be made available in Source Code form under the terms of this License either on the same media as an Executable version or via an accepted Electronic Distribution Mechanism to anyone to whom you made an Executable version available; and if made available via Electronic Distribution Mechanism, must remain available for at least twelve (12) months after the date it initially became available, or at least six (6) months after a subsequent version of that particular Modification has been made available to such recipients. You are responsible for ensuring that the Source Code version remains available even if the Electronic Distribution Mechanism is maintained by a third party.\r\n\r\n3.3 Description of Modifications. \r\nYou must cause all Covered Software to which You contribute to contain a file documenting the changes You made to create that Covered Software and the date of any change. You must include a prominent statement that the Modification is derived, directly or indirectly, from Original Software provided by Nokia and including the name of Nokia in (a) the Source Code, and (b) in any notice in an Executable version or related documentation in which You describe the origin or ownership of the Covered Software.\r\n\r\n3.4  Intellectual Property Matters \r\n(a) Third Party Claims. \r\nIf Contributor has knowledge that a license under a third party's intellectual property rights is required to exercise the rights granted by such Contributor under Sections 2.1 or 2.2, Contributor must include a text file with the Source Code distribution titled \"LEGAL'' which describes the claim and the party making the claim in sufficient detail that a recipient will know whom to contact. If Contributor obtains such knowledge after the Modification is made available as described in Section 3.2, Contributor shall promptly modify the LEGAL file in all copies Contributor makes available thereafter and shall take other steps (such as notifying appropriate mailing lists or newsgroups) reasonably calculated to inform those who received the Covered Software that new knowledge has been obtained.\r\n\r\n(b) Contributor APIs. \r\nIf Contributor's Modifications include an application programming interface and Contributor has knowledge of patent licenses which are reasonably necessary to implement that API, Contributor must also include this information in the LEGAL file.\r\n\r\n(c) Representations. \r\nContributor represents that, except as disclosed pursuant to Section 3.4(a) above, Contributor believes that Contributor's Modifications are Contributor's original creation(s) and/or Contributor has sufficient rights to grant the rights conveyed by this License.\r\n\r\n3.5 Required Notices. \r\nYou must duplicate the notice in Exhibit A in each file of the Source Code. If it is not possible to put such notice in a particular Source Code file due to its structure, then You must include such notice in a location (such as a relevant directory) where a user would be likely to look for such a notice. If You created one or more Modification(s) You may add your name as a Contributor to the notice described in Exhibit A. You must also duplicate this License in any documentation for the Source Code where You describe recipients' rights or ownership rights relating to Covered Software. You may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligations to one or more recipients of Covered Software. However, You may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on behalf of Nokia or any Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear that any such warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligation is offered by You alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify Nokia and every Contributor for any liability incurred by Nokia or such Contributor as a result of warranty, support, indemnity or liability terms You offer.\r\n\r\n3.6 Distribution of Executable Versions. \r\nYou may distribute Covered Software in Executable form only if the requirements of Section 3.1-3.5 have been met for that Covered Software, and if You include a notice stating that the Source Code version of the Covered Software is available under the terms of this License, including a description of how and where You have fulfilled the obligations of Section 3.2. The notice must be conspicuously included in any notice in an Executable version, related documentation or collateral in which You describe recipients' rights relating to the Covered Software. You may distribute the Executable version of Covered Software or ownership rights under a license of Your choice, which may contain terms different from this License, provided that You are in compliance with the terms of this License and that the license for the Executable version does not attempt to limit or alter the recipient's rights in the Source Code version from the rights set forth in this License. If You distribute the Executable version under a different license You must make it absolutely clear that any terms which differ from this License are offered by You alone, not by Nokia or any Contributor. You hereby agree to indemnify Nokia and every Contributor for any liability incurred by Nokia or such Contributor as a result of any such terms You offer.\r\n\r\n3.7 Larger Works. \r\nYou may create a Larger Work by combining Covered Software with other software not governed by the terms of this License and distribute the Larger Work as a single product. In such a case, You must make sure the requirements of this License are fulfilled for the Covered Software.\r\n\r\n4. INABILITY TO COMPLY DUE TO STATUTE OR REGULATION. \r\nIf it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this License with respect to some or all of the Covered Software due to statute, judicial order, or regulation then You must: (a) comply with the terms of this License to the maximum extent possible; and (b) describe the limitations and the code they affect. Such description must be included in the LEGAL file described in Section 3.4 and must be included with all distributions of the Source Code. \r\nExcept to the extent prohibited by statute or regulation, such description must be sufficiently detailed for a recipient of ordinary skill to be able to understand it.\r\n\r\n5. APPLICATION OF THIS LICENSE. \r\nThis License applies to code to which Nokia has attached the notice in Exhibit A and to related Covered Software.\r\n\r\n6. VERSIONS OF THE LICENSE. \r\n6.1 New Versions. \r\nNokia may publish revised and/or new versions of the License from time to time. Each version will be given a distinguishing version number.\r\n\r\n6.2 Effect of New Versions. \r\nOnce Covered Software has been published under a particular version of the License, You may always continue to use it under the terms of that version. You may also choose to use such Covered Software under the terms of any subsequent version of the License published by Nokia. No one other than Nokia has the right to modify the terms applicable to Covered Software created under this License.\r\n\r\n7. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY. \r\nCOVERED SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED UNDER THIS LICENSE ON AN \"AS IS'' BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES THAT THE COVERED SOFTWARE IS FREE OF DEFECTS, MERCHANTABLE, FIT FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR NON-INFRINGING. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE COVERED SOFTWARE IS WITH YOU. SHOULD ANY COVERED SOFTWARE PROVE DEFECTIVE IN ANY RESPECT, YOU (NOT NOKIA, ITS LICENSORS OR AFFILIATES OR ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR) ASSUME THE COST OF ANY NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION. THIS DISCLAIMER OF  WARRANTY CONSTITUTES AN ESSENTIAL PART OF THIS LICENSE. NO USE OF ANY COVERED SOFTWARE IS AUTHORIZED HEREUNDER EXCEPT UNDER THIS DISCLAIMER.\r\n\r\n8. TERMINATION. \r\n8.1 This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate automatically if You fail to comply with terms herein and fail to cure such breach within 30 days of becoming aware of the breach. All sublicenses to the Covered Software which are properly granted shall survive any termination of this License. Provisions which, by their nature, must remain in effect beyond the termination of this License shall survive. \r\n8.2 If You initiate litigation by asserting a patent infringement claim (excluding declatory judgment actions) against Nokia or a Contributor (Nokia or Contributor against whom You file such action is referred to as \"Participant\") alleging that: \r\na) such Participant's Contributor Version directly or indirectly infringes any patent, then any and all rights granted by such Participant to You under Sections 2.1 and/or 2.2 of this License shall, upon 60 days notice from Participant terminate prospectively, unless if within 60 days after receipt of notice You either: (i) agree in writing to pay Participant a mutually agreeable reasonable royalty for Your past and future use of Modifications made by such Participant, or (ii) withdraw Your litigation claim with respect to the Contributor Version against such Participant. If within 60 days of notice, a reasonable royalty and payment arrangement are not mutually agreed upon in writing by the parties or the litigation claim is not withdrawn, the rights granted by Participant to You under Sections 2.1 and/or 2.2 automatically terminate at the expiration of the 60 day notice period specified above. \r\nb) any software, hardware, or device, other than such Participant's Contributor Version, directly or indirectly infringes any patent, then any rights granted to You by such Participant under Sections 2.1(b) and 2.2(b) are revoked effective as of the date You first made, used, sold, distributed, or had made, Modifications made by that Participant.\r\n\r\n8.3 If You assert a patent infringement claim against Participant alleging that such Participant's Contributor Version directly or indirectly infringes any patent where such claim is resolved (such as by license or settlement) prior to the initiation of patent infringement litigation, then the reasonable value of the licenses granted by such Participant under Sections 2.1 or 2.2 shall be taken into account in determining the amount or value of any payment or license. \r\n8.4 In the event of termination under Sections 8.1 or 8.2 above, all end user license agreements (excluding distributors and resellers) which have been validly granted by You or any distributor hereunder prior to termination shall survive termination.\r\n\r\n9. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY. \r\nUNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES AND UNDER NO LEGAL THEORY, WHETHER TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), CONTRACT, OR OTHERWISE, SHALL YOU, NOKIA, ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR, OR ANY DISTRIBUTOR OF COVERED SOFTWARE, OR ANY SUPPLIER OF ANY OF SUCH PARTIES, BE LIABLE TO ANY PERSON FOR ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY CHARACTER INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF GOODWILL, WORK STOPPAGE, COMPUTER FAILURE OR MALFUNCTION, OR ANY AND ALL OTHER COMMERCIAL DAMAGES OR LOSSES, EVEN IF SUCH PARTY SHALL HAVE BEEN INFORMED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. THIS LIMITATION OF LIABILITY SHALL NOT APPLY TO LIABILITY FOR DEATH OR PERSONAL INJURY RESULTING FROM SUCH PARTY'S NEGLIGENCE TO THE EXTENT APPLICABLE LAW PROHIBITS SUCH LIMITATION. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, BUT MAY ALLOW LIABILITY TO BE LIMITED; IN SUCH CASES, A PARTY's, ITS EMPLOYEES, LICENSORS OR AFFILIATES' LIABILITY SHALL BE LIMITED TO U.S. $50. Nothing contained in this License shall prejudice the statutory rights of any party dealing as a consumer.\r\n\r\n10. MISCELLANEOUS. \r\nThis License represents the complete agreement concerning subject matter hereof. All rights in the Covered Software not expressly granted under this License are reserved. Nothing in this License shall grant You any rights to use any of the trademarks of Nokia or any of its Affiliates, even if any of such trademarks are included in any part of Covered Software and/or documentation to it. \r\nThis License is governed by the laws of Finland excluding its conflict-of-law provisions. All disputes arising from or relating to this Agreement shall be settled by a single arbitrator appointed by the Central Chamber of Commerce of Finland. The arbitration procedure shall take place in Helsinki, Finland in the English language. If any part of this Agreement is found void and unenforceable, it will not affect the validity of the balance of the Agreement, which shall remain valid and enforceable according to its terms.\r\n\r\n11. RESPONSIBILITY FOR CLAIMS. \r\nAs between Nokia and the Contributors, each party is responsible for claims and damages arising, directly or indirectly, out of its utilization of rights under this License and You agree to work with Nokia and Contributors to distribute such responsibility on an equitable basis. Nothing herein is intended or shall be deemed to constitute any admission of liability. \r\n \r\n\r\nEXHIBIT A\r\n\r\nThe contents of this file are subject to the NOKOS License Version 1.0 (the \"License\"); you may not use this file except in compliance with the License.\r\n\r\nSoftware distributed under the License is distributed on an \"AS IS\" basis, WITHOUT WARRANTY OF  ANY KIND, either express or implied.

License Grant\r\n\r\nFor purposes of permitting use of your Modifications by OCLC and other licensees hereunder, you hereby grant to OCLC and such other licensees the non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty- free, transferable, sublicenseable license to execute, copy, alter, delete, modify, adapt, change, revise, enhance, develop, publicly display, distribute (internally and externally) and/or create derivative works based on your Modifications (and derivative works thereof) in accordance with these Terms. This Section 4 shall survive termination of this License for any reason.\r\n\r\nSection 5. Termination of Rights\r\n\r\nThis non-exclusive license (with respect to the grant from a particular Contributor) automatically terminates for any entity that initiates legal action for intellectual property infringement (with respect to the Program) against such Contributor as of the initiation of such action.\r\n\r\nIf you fail to comply with this License, your rights (but not your obligations) under this License shall terminate automatically unless you cure such breach within thirty (30) days of becoming aware of the noncompliance. All sublicenses granted by you which preexist such termination and are properly granted shall survive such termination.\r\n\r\nSection 6. Other Terms\r\n\r\nExcept for the copyright notices required above, you may not use any trademark of any of the Contributors without the prior written consent of the relevant Contributor. You agree not to remove, alter or obscure any copyright or other proprietary rights notice contained in the Program.\r\n\r\nAll transfers of the Program or any part thereof shall be made in compliance with U.S. import/export regulations or other restrictions of the U.S. Department of Commerce, as well as other similar trade or commerce restrictions which might apply.\r\n\r\nAny patent obtained by any party covering the Program or any part thereof must include a provision providing for the free, perpetual and unrestricted commercial and noncommercial use by any third party.\r\n\r\nIf, as a consequence of a court judgment or settlement relating to intellectual property infringement or any other cause of action, conditions are imposed on you that contradict the conditions of this License, such conditions do not excuse you from compliance with this License. If you cannot distribute the Program so as to simultaneously satisfy your obligations under this License and such other conditions, you may not distribute the Program at all. For example, if a patent license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, you could not satisfy both the patent license and this License, and you would be required to refrain entirely from distribution of the Program.\r\n\r\nIf you learn of a third party claim or other restriction relating to a Program you have already distributed you shall promptly redo your Program to address the issue and take all reasonable steps to inform those who may have received the Program at issue. An example of an appropriate reasonable step to inform would be posting an announcement on an appropriate web bulletin board.\r\n\r\nThe provisions of this License are deemed to be severable, and the invalidity or unenforceability of any provision shall not affect or impair the remaining provisions which shall continue in full force and effect. In substitution for any provision held unlawful, there shall be substituted a provision of similar import reflecting the original intent of the parties hereto to the extent permissible under law.\r\n\r\nThe Original Contributor from time to time may change this License, and the amended license will apply to all copies of the Program downloaded after the new license is posted. This License grants only the rights expressly stated herein and provides you with no implied rights or licenses to the intellectual property of any Contributor.\r\n\r\nThis License is the complete and exclusive statement of the agreement between the parties concerning the subject matter hereof and may not be amended except by the written agreement of the parties. This License shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Ohio and the United States of America, without regard to principles of conflicts of law.

In consideration of, and as a condition to, the licenses granted to You under this License:\r\n\r\n(a) You grant to Licensor and all third parties a non-exclusive, perpetual, irrevocable, royalty free license under Your Applicable Patent Rights and other intellectual property rights owned or controlled by You, to make, sell, offer for sale, use, import, reproduce, display, perform, modify, distribute and Deploy Your Modifications of the same scope and extent as Licensor's licenses under Sections 2.1 and 2.2; and\r\n\r\n(b) You grant to Licensor and its subsidiaries a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free, perpetual and irrevocable license, under Your Applicable Patent Rights and other intellectual property rights owned or controlled by You, to make, use, sell, offer for sale, import, reproduce, display, perform, distribute, modify or have modified (for Licensor and/or its subsidiaries), sublicense and distribute Your Modifications, in any form and for any purpose, through multiple tiers of distribution.\r\n\r\n(c) You agree not use any information derived from Your use and review of the Covered Code, including but not limited to any algorithms or inventions that may be contained in the Covered Code, for the purpose of asserting any of Your patent rights, or assisting a third party to assert any of its patent rights, against Licensor or any Contributor.\r\n\r\n4. Derivative Works. You may create a Derivative Work by combining Covered Code with other code not otherwise governed by the terms of this License and distribute the Derivative Work as an integrated product. In each such instance, You must make sure the requirements of this License are fulfilled for the Covered Code or any portion thereof, including all Modifications.\r\n\r\n4.1 You must cause any Derivative Work that you distribute, publish or Externally Deploy, that in whole or in part contains or is derived from the Covered Code or any part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third parties under the terms of this License and no other license except as provided in Section 4.2. You also must make Source Code available for the Derivative Work under the same terms as Modifications, described in Sections 2 and 3, above.\r\n\r\n4.2 Compatible Source Licenses. Software modules that have been independently developed without any use of Covered Code and which contain no portion of the Covered Code, Modifications or other Derivative Works, but are used or combined in any way wtih the Covered Code or any Derivative Work to form a larger Derivative Work, are exempt from the conditions described in Section 4.1 but only to the extent that: the software module, including any software that is linked to, integrated with, or part of the same applications as, the software module by any method must be wholly subject to one of the Compatible Source Licenses. Notwithstanding the foregoing, all Covered Code must be subject to the terms of this License. Thus, the entire Derivative Work must be licensed under a combination of the RPSL (for Covered Code) and a Compatible Source License for any independently developed software modules within the Derivative Work. The foregoing requirement applies even if the Compatible Source License would ordinarily allow the software module to link with, or form larger works with, other software that is not subject to the Compatible Source License. For example, although the Mozilla Public License v1.1 allows Mozilla code to be combined with proprietary software that is not subject to the MPL, if MPL-licensed code is used with Covered Code the MPL-licensed code could not be combined or linked with any code not governed by the MPL. The general intent of this section 4.2 is to enable use of Covered Code with applications that are wholly subject to an acceptable open source license. You are responsible for determining whether your use of software with Covered Code is allowed under Your license to such software.\r\n\r\n4.3 Mere aggregation of another work not based on the Covered Code with the Covered Code (or with a work based on the Covered Code) on a volume of a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under the scope of this License. If You deliver the Covered Code for combination and/or integration with an application previously provided by You (for example, via automatic updating technology), such combination and/or integration constitutes a Derivative Work subject to the terms of this License.\r\n\r\n5. Exclusions From License Grant. Nothing in this License shall be deemed to grant any rights to trademarks, copyrights, patents, trade secrets or any other intellectual property of Licensor or any Contributor except as expressly stated herein. No right is granted to the trademarks of Licensor or any Contributor even if such marks are included in the Covered Code. Nothing in this License shall be interpreted to prohibit Licensor from licensing under different terms from this License any code that Licensor otherwise would have a right to license. Modifications, Derivative Works and/or any use or combination of Covered Code with other technology provided by Licensor or third parties may require additional patent licenses from Licensor which Licensor may grant in its sole discretion. No patent license is granted separate from the Original Code or combinations of the Original Code with other software or hardware.\r\n\r\n5.1. Trademarks. This License does not grant any rights to use the trademarks or trade names owned by Licensor (\"Licensor Marks\" defined in Exhibit C) or to any trademark or trade name belonging to any Contributor. No Licensor Marks may be used to endorse or promote products derived from the Original Code other than as permitted by the Licensor Trademark Policy defined in Exhibit C.\r\n\r\n6. Additional Terms. You may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligations and/or other rights consistent with the scope of the license granted herein (\"Additional Terms\") to one or more recipients of Covered Code. However, You may do so only on Your own behalf and as Your sole responsibility, and not on behalf of Licensor or any Contributor. You must obtain the recipient's agreement that any such Additional Terms are offered by You alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify, defend and hold Licensor and every Contributor harmless for any liability incurred by or claims asserted against Licensor or such Contributor by reason of any such Additional Terms.\r\n\r\n7. Versions of the License. Licensor may publish revised and/or new versions of this License from time to time. Each version will be given a distinguishing version number. Once Original Code has been published under a particular version of this License, You may continue to use it under the terms of that version. You may also choose to use such Original Code under the terms of any subsequent version of this License published by Licensor. No one other than Licensor has the right to modify the terms applicable to Covered Code created under this License.\r\n\r\n8. NO WARRANTY OR SUPPORT. The Covered Code may contain in whole or in part pre-release, untested, or not fully tested works. The Covered Code may contain errors that could cause failures or loss of data, and may be incomplete or contain inaccuracies. You expressly acknowledge and agree that use of the Covered Code, or any portion thereof, is at Your sole and entire risk. THE COVERED CODE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\" AND WITHOUT WARRANTY, UPGRADES OR SUPPORT OF ANY KIND AND LICENSOR AND LICENSOR'S LICENSOR(S) (COLLECTIVELY REFERRED TO AS \"LICENSOR\" FOR THE PURPOSES OF SECTIONS 8 AND 9) AND ALL CONTRIBUTORS EXPRESSLY DISCLAIM ALL WARRANTIES AND/OR CONDITIONS, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES AND/OR CONDITIONS OF MERCHANTABILITY, OF SATISFACTORY QUALITY, OF FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, OF ACCURACY, OF QUIET ENJOYMENT, AND NONINFRINGEMENT OF THIRD PARTY RIGHTS. LICENSOR AND EACH CONTRIBUTOR DOES NOT WARRANT AGAINST INTERFERENCE WITH YOUR ENJOYMENT OF THE COVERED CODE, THAT THE FUNCTIONS CONTAINED IN THE COVERED CODE WILL MEET YOUR REQUIREMENTS, THAT THE OPERATION OF THE COVERED CODE WILL BE UNINTERRUPTED OR ERROR-FREE, OR THAT DEFECTS IN THE COVERED CODE WILL BE CORRECTED. NO ORAL OR WRITTEN DOCUMENTATION, INFORMATION OR ADVICE GIVEN BY LICENSOR, A LICENSOR AUTHORIZED REPRESENTATIVE OR ANY CONTRIBUTOR SHALL CREATE A WARRANTY. You acknowledge that the Covered Code is not intended for use in high risk activities, including, but not limited to, the design, construction, operation or maintenance of nuclear facilities, aircraft navigation, aircraft communication systems, or air traffic control machines in which case the failure of the Covered Code could lead to death, personal injury, or severe physical or environmental damage. Licensor disclaims any express or implied warranty of fitness for such uses.\r\n\r\n9. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY. TO THE EXTENT NOT PROHIBITED BY LAW, IN NO EVENT SHALL LICENSOR OR ANY CONTRIBUTOR BE LIABLE FOR ANY INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, INDIRECT OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS LICENSE OR YOUR USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE COVERED CODE, OR ANY PORTION THEREOF, WHETHER UNDER A THEORY OF CONTRACT, WARRANTY, TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE OR STRICT LIABILITY), PRODUCTS LIABILITY OR OTHERWISE, EVEN IF LICENSOR OR SUCH CONTRIBUTOR HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES AND NOTWITHSTANDING THE FAILURE OF ESSENTIAL PURPOSE OF ANY REMEDY. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE LIMITATION OF LIABILITY OF INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO THIS LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU. In no event shall Licensor's total liability to You for all damages (other than as may be required by applicable law) under this License exceed the amount of ten dollars ($10.00).\r\n\r\n10. Ownership. Subject to the licenses granted under this License, each Contributor retains all rights, title and interest in and to any Modifications made by such Contributor. Licensor retains all rights, title and interest in and to the Original Code and any Modifications made by or on behalf of Licensor (\"Licensor Modifications\"), and such Licensor Modifications will not be automatically subject to this License. Licensor may, at its sole discretion, choose to license such Licensor Modifications under this License, or on different terms from those contained in this License or may choose not to license them at all.\r\n\r\n11. Termination.\r\n\r\n11.1 Term and Termination. The term of this License is perpetual unless terminated as provided below. This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate:\r\n\r\n(a) automatically without notice from Licensor if You fail to comply with any term(s) of this License and fail to cure such breach within 30 days of becoming aware of such breach;\r\n\r\n(b) immediately in the event of the circumstances described in Section 12.5(b); or\r\n\r\n(c) automatically without notice from Licensor if You, at any time during the term of this License, commence an action for patent infringement against Licensor (including by cross-claim or counter claim in a lawsuit);\r\n\r\n(d) upon written notice from Licensor if You, at any time during the term of this License, commence an action for patent infringement against any third party alleging that the Covered Code itself (excluding combinations with other software or hardware) infringes any patent (including by cross-claim or counter claim in a lawsuit).\r\n\r\n11.2 Effect of Termination. Upon termination, You agree to immediately stop any further use, reproduction, modification, sublicensing and distribution of the Covered Code and to destroy all copies of the Covered Code that are in your possession or control. All sublicenses to the Covered Code which have been properly granted prior to termination shall survive any termination of this License. Provisions which, by their nature, should remain in effect beyond the termination of this License shall survive, including but not limited to Sections 3, 5, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12.2 and 13. No party will be liable to any other for compensation, indemnity or damages of any sort solely as a result of terminating this License in accordance with its terms, and termination of this License will be without prejudice to any other right or remedy of any party.\r\n\r\n12. Miscellaneous.\r\n\r\n12.1 Government End Users. The Covered Code is a \"commercial item\" as defined in FAR 2.101. Government software and technical data rights in the Covered Code include only those rights customarily provided to the public as defined in this License. This customary commercial license in technical data and software is provided in accordance with FAR 12.211 (Technical Data) and 12.212 (Computer Software) and, for Department of Defense purchases, DFAR 252.227-7015 (Technical Data -- Commercial Items) and 227.7202-3 (Rights in Commercial Computer Software or Computer Software Documentation). Accordingly, all U.S. Government End Users acquire Covered Code with only those rights set forth herein.\r\n\r\n12.2 Relationship of Parties. This License will not be construed as creating an agency, partnership, joint venture or any other form of legal association between or among You, Licensor or any Contributor, and You will not represent to the contrary, whether expressly, by implication, appearance or otherwise.\r\n\r\n12.3 Independent Development. Nothing in this License will impair Licensor's right to acquire, license, develop, have others develop for it, market and/or distribute technology or products that perform the same or similar functions as, or otherwise compete with, Modifications, Derivative Works, technology or products that You may develop, produce, market or distribute.\r\n\r\n12.4 Waiver; Construction. Failure by Licensor or any Contributor to enforce any provision of this License will not be deemed a waiver of future enforcement of that or any other provision. Any law or regulation which provides that the language of a contract shall be construed against the drafter will not apply to this License.\r\n\r\n12.5 Severability. (a) If for any reason a court of competent jurisdiction finds any provision of this License, or portion thereof, to be unenforceable, that provision of the License will be enforced to the maximum extent permissible so as to effect the economic benefits and intent of the parties, and the remainder of this License will continue in full force and effect. (b) Notwithstanding the foregoing, if applicable law prohibits or restricts You from fully and/or specifically complying with Sections 2 and/or 3 or prevents the enforceability of either of those Sections, this License will immediately terminate and You must immediately discontinue any use of the Covered Code and destroy all copies of it that are in your possession or control.\r\n\r\n12.6 Dispute Resolution. Any litigation or other dispute resolution between You and Licensor relating to this License shall take place in the Seattle, Washington, and You and Licensor hereby consent to the personal jurisdiction of, and venue in, the state and federal courts within that District with respect to this License. The application of the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods is expressly excluded.\r\n\r\n12.7 Export/Import Laws. This software is subject to all export and import laws and restrictions and regulations of the country in which you receive the Covered Code and You are solely responsible for ensuring that You do not export, re-export or import the Covered Code or any direct product thereof in violation of any such restrictions, laws or regulations, or without all necessary authorizations.\r\n\r\n12.8 Entire Agreement; Governing Law. This License constitutes the entire agreement between the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof. This License shall be governed by the laws of the United States and the State of Washington.\r\n\r\nWhere You are located in the province of Quebec, Canada, the following clause applies: The parties hereby confirm that they have requested that this License and all related documents be drafted in English. Les parties ont exigé que le présent contrat et tous les documents connexes soient rédigés en anglais.\r\n\r\nEXHIBIT A.\r\n\r\n\"Copyright © 1995-2002 RealNetworks, Inc. and/or its licensors.

Distribution Obligations.\r\n\r\n3.1. Application of License. The Modifications which You create or to which You contribute are governed by the terms of this License, including without limitation Section 2.2. The Source Code version of Governed Code may be distributed only under the terms of this License or a future version of this License released under Section 6.1, and You must include a copy of this License with every copy of the Source Code You distribute. You may not offer or impose any terms on any Source Code version that alters or restricts the applicable version of this License or the recipients' rights hereunder. However, You may include an additional document offering the additional rights described in Section 3.5.\r\n\r\n3.2. Availability of Source Code. Any Modification which You create or to which You contribute must be made available in Source Code form under the terms of this License either on the same media as an Executable Code version or via an Electronic Distribution Mechanism to anyone to whom you made an Executable Code version available; and if made available via an Electronic Distribution Mechanism, must remain available for at least twelve (12) months after the date it initially became available, or at least six (6) months after a subsequent version of that particular Modification has been made available to such recipients. You are responsible for ensuring that the Source Code version remains available even if the Electronic Distribution Mechanism is maintained by a third party.\r\n\r\n3.3. Description of Modifications. You must cause all Governed Code to which you contribute to contain a file documenting the changes You made to create that Governed Code and the date of any change. You must include a prominent statement that the Modification is derived, directly or indirectly, from Original Code provided by RSV and including the name of RSV in (a) the Source Code, and (b) in any notice in an Executable Code version or related documentation in which You describe the origin or ownership of the Governed Code.\r\n\r\n3.4. Intellectual Property Matters.\r\n\r\n3.4.1.\tThird Party Claims. If You have knowledge that a party claims an intellectual property right in particular functionality or code (or its utilization under this License), you must include a text file with the source code distribution titled \"LEGAL\" which describes the claim and the party making the claim in sufficient detail that a recipient will know whom to contact. If you obtain such knowledge after You make Your Modification available as described in Section 3.2, You shall promptly modify the LEGAL file in all copies You make available thereafter and shall take other steps (such as notifying RSV and appropriate mailing lists or newsgroups) reasonably calculated to inform those who received the Governed Code that new knowledge has been obtained. In the event that You are a Contributor, You represent that, except as disclosed in the LEGAL file, your Modifications are your original creations and, to the best of your knowledge, no third party has any claim (including but not limited to intellectual property claims) relating to your Modifications. You represent that the LEGAL file includes complete details of any license or other restriction associated with any part of your Modifications.\r\n\r\n3.4.2. Contributor APIs. If Your Modification is an application programming interface and You own or control patents which are reasonably necessary to implement that API, you must also include this information in the LEGAL file.\r\n\r\n3.5. Required Notices. You must duplicate the notice in Exhibit A in each file of the Source Code, and this License in any documentation for the Source Code, where You describe recipients' rights relating to Governed Code. If You created one or more Modification(s), You may add your name as a Contributor to the notice described in Exhibit A. If it is not possible to put such notice in a particular Source Code file due to its structure, then you must include such notice in a location (such as a relevant directory file) where a user would be likely to look for such a notice. You may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligations to one or more recipients of Governed Code. However, You may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on behalf of RSV or any Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear than any such warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligation is offered by You alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify RSV and every Contributor for any liability incurred by RSV or such Contributor as a result of warranty, support, indemnity or liability terms You offer.\r\n\r\n3.6. Distribution of Executable Code Versions. You may distribute Governed Code in Executable Code form only if the requirements of Section 3.1-3.5 have been met for that Governed Code, and if You include a prominent notice stating that the Source Code version of the Governed Code is available under the terms of this License, including a description of how and where You have fulfilled the obligations of Section 3.2. The notice must be conspicuously included in any notice in an Executable Code version, related documentation or collateral in which You describe recipients' rights relating to the Governed Code. You may distribute the Executable Code version of Governed Code under a license of Your choice, which may contain terms different from this License, provided that You are in compliance with the terms of this License and that the license for the Executable Code version does not attempt to limit or alter the recipient's rights in the Source Code version from the rights set forth in this License. If You distribute the Executable Code version under a different license You must make it absolutely clear that any terms which differ from this License are offered by You alone, not by RSV or any Contributor. You hereby agree to indemnify RSV and every Contributor for any liability incurred by RSV or such Contributor as a result of any such terms You offer.\r\n\r\n3.7. Larger Works. You may create a Larger Work by combining Governed Code with other code not governed by the terms of this License and distribute the Larger Work as a single product. In such a case, You must make sure the requirements of this License are fulfilled for the Governed Code.\r\n\r\n4. Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation.\r\n\r\nIf it is impossible for You to comply with any of theterms of this License with respect to some or all of the Governed Code due to statute or regulation then You must: (a) comply with the terms of this License to the maximum extent possible; and (b) describe the limitations and the code they affect. Such description must be included in the LEGAL file described in Section 3.4 and must be included with all distributions of the Source Code. Except to the extent prohibited by statute or regulation, such description must be sufficiently detailed for a recipient of ordinary skill to be able to understand it.\r\n\r\n5. Trademark Usage.\r\n\r\n5.1.\tAdvertising Materials. All advertising materials mentioning features or use of the Governed Code must display the following acknowledgement: \"This product includes software developed by Ricoh Silicon Valley, Inc.\"\r\n\r\n5.2.\tEndorsements. The names \"Ricoh,\" \"Ricoh Silicon Valley,\" and \"RSV\" must not be used to endorse or promote Contributor Versions or Larger Works without the prior written permission of RSV.\r\n\r\n5.3.\tProduct Names. Contributor Versions and Larger Works may not be called \"Ricoh\" nor may the word \"Ricoh\" appear in their names without the prior written permission of RSV.\r\n\r\n6. Versions of the License.\r\n\r\n6.1. New Versions. RSV may publish revised and/or new versions of the License from time to time. Each version will be given a distinguishing version number.\r\n\r\n6.2. Effect of New Versions. Once Governed Code has been published under a particular version of the License, You may always continue to use it under the terms of that version. You may also choose to use such Governed Code under the terms of any subsequent version of the License published by RSV. No one other than RSV has the right to modify the terms applicable to Governed Code created under this License.\r\n\r\n7. Disclaimer of Warranty.\r\n\r\nGOVERNED CODE IS PROVIDED UNDER THIS LICENSE ON AN \"AS IS\" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES THAT THE GOVERNED CODE IS FREE OF DEFECTS, MERCHANTABLE, FIT FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR NON-INFRINGING. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE GOVERNED CODE IS WITH YOU. SHOULD ANY GOVERNED CODE PROVE DEFECTIVE IN ANY RESPECT, YOU (NOT RSV OR ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR) ASSUME THE COST OF ANY NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION. THIS DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY CONSTITUTES AN ESSENTIAL PART OF THIS LICENSE. NO USE OF ANY GOVERNED CODE IS AUTHORIZED HEREUNDER EXCEPT UNDER THIS DISCLAIMER.\r\n\r\n8. Termination.\r\n\r\n8.1. This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate automatically if You fail to comply with terms herein and fail to cure such breach within 30 days of becoming aware of the breach. All sublicenses to the Governed Code which are properly granted shall survive any termination of this License. Provisions which, by their nature, must remain in effect beyond the termination of this License shall survive.\r\n\r\n8.2. If You initiate patent infringement litigation against RSV or a Contributor (RSV or the Contributor against whom You file such action is referred to as \"Participant\") alleging that:\r\n\r\n(a) such Participant's Original Code or Contributor Version directly or indirectly infringes any patent, then any and all rights granted by such Participant to You under Sections 2.1 and/or 2.2 of this License shall, upon 60 days notice from Participant terminate prospectively, unless if within 60 days after receipt of notice You either: (i) agree in writing to pay Participant a mutually agreeable reasonable royalty for Your past and future use of the Original Code or the Modifications made by such Participant, or (ii) withdraw Your litigation claim with respect to the Original Code or the Contributor Version against such Participant. If within 60 days of notice, a reasonable royalty and payment arrangement are not mutually agreed upon in writing by the parties or the litigation claim is not withdrawn, the rights granted by Participant to You under Sections 2.1 and/or 2.2 automatically terminate at the expiration of the 60 day notice period specified above.\r\n\r\n(b) any software, hardware, or device provided to You by the Participant, other than such Participant's Original Code or Contributor Version, directly or indirectly infringes any patent, then any rights granted to You by such Participant under Sections 2.1(b) and 2.2(b) are revoked effective as of the date You first made, used, sold, distributed, or had made, Original Code or the Modifications made by that Participant.\r\n\r\n8.3. If You assert a patent infringement claim against Participant alleging that such Participant's Original Code or Contributor Version directly or indirectly infringes any patent where such claim is resolved (such as by license or settlement) prior to the initiation of patent infringement litigation, then the reasonable value of the licenses granted by such Participant under Sections 2.1 or 2.2 shall be taken into account in determining the amount or value of any payment or license.\r\n\r\n8.4. In the event of termination under Sections 8.1 or 8.2 above, all end user license agreements (excluding distributors and resellers) which have been validly granted by You or any distributor hereunder prior to termination shall survive termination.\r\n\r\n9. Limitation of Liability.\r\n\r\nUNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES AND UNDER NO LEGAL THEORY, WHETHER TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), CONTRACT, OR OTHERWISE, SHALL RSV, ANY CONTRIBUTOR, OR ANY DISTRIBUTOR OF GOVERNED CODE, OR ANY SUPPLIER OF ANY OF SUCH PARTIES, BE LIABLE TO YOU OR ANY OTHER PERSON FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY CHARACTER INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF GOODWILL, WORK STOPPAGE, COMPUTER FAILURE OR MALFUNCTION, OR ANY AND ALL OTHER COMMERCIAL DAMAGES OR LOSSES, EVEN IF SUCH PARTY SHALL HAVE BEEN INFORMED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. THIS LIMITATION OF LIABILITY SHALL NOT APPLY TO LIABILITY FOR DEATH OR PERSONAL INJURY RESULTING FROM SUCH PARTY'S NEGLIGENCE TO THE EXTENT APPLICABLE LAW PROHIBITS SUCH LIMITATION. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO THAT EXCLUSION AND LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU. TO THE EXTENT THAT ANY EXCLUSION OF DAMAGES ABOVE IS NOT VALID, YOU AGREE THAT IN NO EVENT WILL RSVS LIABILITY UNDER OR RELATED TO THIS AGREEMENT EXCEED FIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS ($5,000). THE GOVERNED CODE IS NOT INTENDED FOR USE IN CONNECTION WITH ANY NUCLER, AVIATION, MASS TRANSIT OR MEDICAL APPLICATION OR ANY OTHER INHERENTLY DANGEROUS APPLICATION THAT COULD RESULT IN DEATH, PERSONAL INJURY, CATASTROPHIC DAMAGE OR MASS DESTRUCTION, AND YOU AGREE THAT NEITHER RSV NOR ANY CONTRIBUTOR SHALL HAVE ANY LIABILITY OF ANY NATURE AS A RESULT OF ANY SUCH USE OF THE GOVERNED CODE.\r\n\r\n10. U.S. Government End Users.\r\n\r\nThe Governed Code is a \"commercial item,\" as that term is defined in 48 C.F.R. 2.101 (Oct. 1995), consisting of \"commercial computer software\" and \"commercial computer software documentation,\" as such terms are used in 48 C.F.R. 12.212 (Sept. 1995). Consistent with 48 C.F.R. 12.212 and 48 C.F.R. 227.7202-1 through 227.7202-4 (June 1995), all U.S. Government End Users acquire Governed Code with only those rights set forth herein.\r\n\r\n11. Miscellaneous.\r\n\r\nThis License represents the complete agreement concerning subject matter hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be unenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only to the extent necessary to make it enforceable. This License shall be governed by California law provisions (except to the extent applicable law, if any, provides otherwise), excluding its conflict-of-law provisions. The parties submit to personal jurisdiction in California and further agree that any cause of action arising under or related to this Agreement shall be brought in the Federal Courts of the Northern District of California, with venue lying in Santa Clara County, California. The losing party shall be responsible for costs, including without limitation, court costs and reasonable attorneys fees and expenses. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, RSV may seek injunctive relief related to a breach of this Agreement in any court of competent jurisdiction. The application of the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods is expressly excluded. Any law or regulation which provides that the language of a contract shall be construed against the drafter shall not apply to this License.\r\n\r\n12. Responsibility for Claims.\r\n\r\nExcept in cases where another Contributor has failed to comply with Section 3.4, You are responsible for damages arising, directly or indirectly, out of Your utilization of rights under this License, based on the number of copies of Governed Code you made available, the revenues you received from utilizing such rights, and other relevant factors. You agree to work with affected parties to distribute responsibility on an equitable basis.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nEXHIBIT A\r\n\r\n\"The contents of this file are subject to the Ricoh Source Code Public License Version 1.0 (the \"License\"); you may not use this file except in compliance with the License.

Distribution Obligations.\r\n\r\n3.1. Application of License.\r\n\r\nThe Modifications which You create or to which You contribute are governed by the terms of this License, including without limitation Section 2.2. The Source Code version of Covered Code may be distributed only under the terms of this License or a future version of this License released under Section 6.1, and You must include a copy of this License with every copy of the Source Code You distribute. You may not offer or impose any terms on any Source Code version that alters or restricts the applicable version of this License or the recipients' rights hereunder. However, You may include an additional document offering the additional rights described in Section 3.5.\r\n\r\n3.2. Availability of Source Code.\r\n\r\nAny Modification which You create or to which You contribute must be made available in Source Code form under the terms of this License either on the same media as an Executable version or via an accepted Electronic Distribution Mechanism to anyone to whom you made an Executable version available; and if made available via Electronic Distribution Mechanism, must remain available for at least twelve (12) months after the date it initially became available, or at least six (6) months after a subsequent version of that particular Modification has been made available to such recipients. You are responsible for ensuring that the Source Code version remains available even if the Electronic Distribution Mechanism is maintained by a third party.\r\n\r\n3.3. Description of Modifications.\r\n\r\nYou must cause all Covered Code to which You contribute to contain a file documenting the changes You made to create that Covered Code and the date of any change. You must include a prominent statement that the Modification is derived, directly or indirectly, from Original Code provided by the Initial Developer and including the name of the Initial Developer in (a) the Source Code, and (b) in any notice in an Executable version or related documentation in which You describe the origin or ownership of the Covered Code.\r\n\r\n3.4. Intellectual Property Matters.\r\n\r\n(a) Third Party Claims. If Contributor has knowledge that a license under a third party's intellectual property rights is required to exercise the rights granted by such Contributor under Sections 2.1 or 2.2, Contributor must include a text file with the Source Code distribution titled \"../LEGAL'' which describes the claim and the party making the claim in sufficient detail that a recipient will know whom to contact. If Contributor obtains such knowledge after the Modification is made available as described in Section 3.2, Contributor shall promptly modify the LEGAL file in all copies Contributor makes available thereafter and shall take other steps (such as notifying appropriate mailing lists or newsgroups) reasonably calculated to inform those who received the Covered Code that new knowledge has been obtained.\r\n\r\n(b) Contributor APIs.\r\n\r\nIf Contributor's Modifications include an application programming interface (\"API\"../) and Contributor has knowledge of patent licenses which are reasonably necessary to implement that API, Contributor must also include this information in the LEGAL file.\r\n\r\n(c) Representations.\r\n\r\nContributor represents that, except as disclosed pursuant to Section 3.4(a) above, Contributor believes that Contributor's Modifications are Contributor's original creation(s) and/or Contributor has sufficient rights to grant the rights conveyed by this License\r\n\r\n.\r\n3.5. Required Notices.\r\n\r\nYou must duplicate the notice in Exhibit A in each file of the Source Code. If it is not possible to put such notice in a particular Source Code file due to its structure, then You must include such notice in a location (such as a relevant directory) where a user would be likely to look for such a notice. If You created one or more Modification(s) You may add your name as a Contributor to the notice described in Exhibit A. You must also duplicate this License in any documentation for the Source Code where You describe recipients' rights or ownership rights relating to Covered Code. You may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligations to one or more recipients of Covered Code. However, You may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on behalf of the Initial Developer or any Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear than any such warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligation is offered by You alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify the Initial Developer and every Contributor for any liability incurred by the Initial Developer or such Contributor as a result of warranty, support, indemnity or liability terms You offer.\r\n\r\n3.6. Distribution of Executable Versions.\r\n\r\nYou may distribute Covered Code in Executable form only if the requirements of Section 3.1-3.5 have been met for that Covered Code, and if You include a notice stating that the Source Code version of the Covered Code is available under the terms of this License, including a description of how and where You have fulfilled the obligations of Section 3.2. The notice must be conspicuously included in any notice in an Executable version, related documentation or collateral in which You describe recipients' rights relating to the Covered Code. You may distribute the Executable version of Covered Code or ownership rights under a license of Your choice, which may contain terms different from this License, provided that You are in compliance with the terms of this License and that the license for the Executable version does not attempt to limit or alter the recipient's rights in the Source Code version from the rights set forth in this License. If You distribute the Executable version under a different license You must make it absolutely clear that any terms which differ from this License are offered by You alone, not by the Initial Developer or any Contributor. You hereby agree to indemnify the Initial Developer and every Contributor for any liability incurred by the Initial Developer or such Contributor as a result of any such terms You offer.\r\n\r\n3.7. Larger Works.\r\n\r\nYou may create a Larger Work by combining Covered Code with other code not governed by the terms of this License and distribute the Larger Work as a single product. In such a case, You must make sure the requirements of this License are fulfilled for the Covered Code.\r\n\r\n4. Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation.\r\n\r\nIf it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this License with respect to some or all of the Covered Code due to statute, judicial order, or regulation then You must: (a) comply with the terms of this License to the maximum extent possible; and (b) describe the limitations and the code they affect. Such description must be included in the LEGAL file described in Section 3.4 and must be included with all distributions of the Source Code. Except to the extent prohibited by statute or regulation, such description must be sufficiently detailed for a recipient of ordinary skill to be able to understand it.\r\n\r\n5. Application of this License.\r\n\r\nThis License applies to code to which the Initial Developer has attached the notice in Exhibit A and to related Covered Code.\r\n\r\n6. Versions of the License.\r\n\r\n6.1. New Versions. Sun Microsystems, Inc. (\"Sun\") may publish revised and/or new versions of the License from time to time. Each version will be given a distinguishing version number.\r\n6.2. Effect of New Versions.\r\n\r\nOnce Covered Code has been published under a particular version of the License, You may always continue to use it under the terms of that version. You may also choose to use such Covered Code under the terms of any subsequent version of the License published by Sun. No one other than Sun has the right to modify the terms applicable to Covered Code created under this License.\r\n\r\n6.3. Derivative Works.\r\n\r\nIf You create or use a modified version of this License (which you may only do in order to apply it to code which is not already Covered Code governed by this License), You must: (a) rename Your license so that the phrases \"Sun,\" \"Sun Public License,\" or \"SPL\"../ or any confusingly similar phrase do not appear in your license (except to note that your license differs from this License) and (b) otherwise make it clear that Your version of the license contains terms which differ from the Sun Public License. (Filling in the name of the Initial Developer, Original Code or Contributor in the notice described in Exhibit A shall not of themselves be deemed to be modifications of this License.)\r\n\r\n7. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY.\r\n\r\nCOVERED CODE IS PROVIDED UNDER THIS LICENSE ON AN \"../AS IS'' BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES THAT THE COVERED CODE IS FREE OF DEFECTS, MERCHANTABLE, FIT FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR NON-INFRINGING. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE COVERED CODE IS WITH YOU. SHOULD ANY COVERED CODE PROVE DEFECTIVE IN ANY RESPECT, YOU (NOT THE INITIAL DEVELOPER OR ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR) ASSUME THE COST OF ANY NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION. THIS DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY CONSTITUTES AN ESSENTIAL PART OF THIS LICENSE. NO USE OF ANY COVERED CODE IS AUTHORIZED HEREUNDER EXCEPT UNDER THIS DISCLAIMER.\r\n\r\n8. TERMINATION.\r\n\r\n8.1. This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate automatically if You fail to comply with terms herein and fail to cure such breach within 30 days of becoming aware of the breach. All sublicenses to the Covered Code which are properly granted shall survive any termination of this License. Provisions which, by their nature, must remain in effect beyond the termination of this License shall survive.\r\n\r\n8.2. If You initiate litigation by asserting a patent infringement claim (excluding declaratory judgment actions) against Initial Developer or a Contributor (the Initial Developer or Contributor against whom You file such action is referred to as \"Participant\") alleging that:\r\n\r\n(a) such Participant's Contributor Version directly or indirectly infringes any patent, then any and all rights granted by such Participant to You under Sections 2.1 and/or 2.2 of this License shall, upon 60 days notice from Participant terminate prospectively, unless if within 60 days after receipt of notice You either: (i) agree in writing to pay Participant a mutually agreeable reasonable royalty for Your past and future use of Modifications made by such Participant, or (ii) withdraw Your litigation claim with respect to the Contributor Version against such Participant. If within 60 days of notice, a reasonable royalty and payment arrangement are not mutually agreed upon in writing by the parties or the litigation claim is not withdrawn, the rights granted by Participant to You under Sections 2.1 and/or 2.2 automatically terminate at the expiration of the 60 day notice period specified above.\r\n\r\n(b) any software, hardware, or device, other than such Participant's Contributor Version, directly or indirectly infringes any patent, then any rights granted to You by such Participant under Sections 2.1(b) and 2.2(b) are revoked effective as of the date You first made, used, sold, distributed, or had made, Modifications made by that Participant.\r\n\r\n8.3. If You assert a patent infringement claim against Participant alleging that such Participant's Contributor Version directly or indirectly infringes any patent where such claim is resolved (such as by license or settlement) prior to the initiation of patent infringement litigation, then the reasonable value of the licenses granted by such Participant under Sections 2.1 or 2.2 shall be taken into account in determining the amount or value of any payment or license.\r\n\r\n8.4. In the event of termination under Sections 8.1 or 8.2 above, all end user license agreements (excluding distributors and resellers) which have been validly granted by You or any distributor hereunder prior to termination shall survive termination.\r\n\r\n9. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY.\r\n\r\nUNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES AND UNDER NO LEGAL THEORY, WHETHER TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), CONTRACT, OR OTHERWISE, SHALL YOU, THE INITIAL DEVELOPER, ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR, OR ANY DISTRIBUTOR OF COVERED CODE, OR ANY SUPPLIER OF ANY OF SUCH PARTIES, BE LIABLE TO ANY PERSON FOR ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY CHARACTER INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF GOODWILL, WORK STOPPAGE, COMPUTER FAILURE OR MALFUNCTION, OR ANY AND ALL OTHER COMMERCIAL DAMAGES OR LOSSES, EVEN IF SUCH PARTY SHALL HAVE BEEN INFORMED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. THIS LIMITATION OF LIABILITY SHALL NOT APPLY TO LIABILITY FOR DEATH OR PERSONAL INJURY RESULTING FROM SUCH PARTY'S NEGLIGENCE TO THE EXTENT APPLICABLE LAW PROHIBITS SUCH LIMITATION. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO THIS EXCLUSION AND LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.\r\n\r\n10. U.S. GOVERNMENT END USERS.\r\n\r\nThe Covered Code is a \"commercial item,\" as that term is defined in 48 C.F.R. 2.101 (Oct. 1995), consisting of \"commercial computer software\" and \"commercial computer software documentation,\"../ as such terms are used in 48 C.F.R. 12.212 (Sept. 1995). Consistent with 48 C.F.R. 12.212 and 48 C.F.R. 227.7202-1 through 227.7202-4 (June 1995), all U.S. Government End Users acquire Covered Code with only those rights set forth herein.\r\n\r\n11. MISCELLANEOUS.\r\n\r\nThis License represents the complete agreement concerning subject matter hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be unenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only to the extent necessary to make it enforceable. This License shall be governed by California law provisions (except to the extent applicable law, if any, provides otherwise), excluding its conflict-of-law provisions. With respect to disputes in which at least one party is a citizen of, or an entity chartered or registered to do business in the United States of America, any litigation relating to this License shall be subject to the jurisdiction of the Federal Courts of the Northern District of California, with venue lying in Santa Clara County, California, with the losing party responsible for costs, including without limitation, court costs and reasonable attorneys' fees and expenses. The application of the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods is expressly excluded. Any law or regulation which provides that the language of a contract shall be construed against the drafter shall not apply to this License.\r\n\r\n12.

As used in this License:\r\n\r\n1.1 \"Applicable Patent Rights\" mean: (a) in the case where Sybase is the grantor of rights, (i) claims of patents that are now or hereafter acquired, owned by or assigned to Sybase and (ii) that cover subject matter contained in the Original Code, but only to the extent necessary to use, reproduce and/or distribute the Original Code without infringement; and (b) in the case where You are the grantor of rights, (i) claims of patents that are now or hereafter acquired, owned by or assigned to You and (ii) that cover subject matter in Your Modifications, taken alone or in combination with Original Code.\r\n\r\n1.2 \"Contributor\" means any person or entity that creates or contributes to the creation of Modifications.\r\n\r\n1.3 \"Covered Code\" means the Original Code, Modifications, the combination of Original Code and any Modifications, and/or any respective portions thereof.\r\n\r\n1.4 \"Deploy\" means to use, sublicense or distribute Covered Code other than for Your internal research and development (R&D) and/or Personal Use, and includes without limitation, any and all internal use or distribution of Covered Code within Your business or organization except for R&D use and/or Personal Use, as well as direct or indirect sublicensing or distribution of Covered Code by You to any third party in any form or manner.\r\n\r\n1.5 \"Larger Work\" means a work which combines Covered Code or portions thereof with code not governed by the terms of this License.\r\n\r\n1.6 \"Modifications\" mean any addition to, deletion from, and/or change to, the substance and/or structure of the Original Code, any previous Modifications, the combination of Original Code and any previous Modifications, and/or any respective portions thereof.

Permitted Uses; Conditions & Restrictions.Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, Sybase hereby grants You, effective on the date You accept this License and download the Original Code, a world-wide, royalty-free, non-exclusive license, to the extent of Sybase's Applicable Patent Rights and copyrights covering the Original Code, to do the following:\r\n\r\n2.1 You may use, reproduce, display, perform, modify and distribute Original Code, with or without Modifications, solely for Your internal research and development and/or Personal Use, provided that in each instance:\r\n(a) You must retain and reproduce in all copies of Original Code the copyright and other proprietary notices and disclaimers of Sybase as they appear in the Original Code, and keep intact all notices in the Original Code that refer to this License; and \r\n(b) You must retain and reproduce a copy of this License with every copy of Source Code of Covered Code and documentation You distribute, and You may not offer or impose any terms on such Source Code that alter or restrict this License or the recipients' rights hereunder, except as permitted under Section 6.\r\n(c) Whenever reasonably feasible you should include the copy of this License in a click-wrap format, which requires affirmative acceptance by clicking on an \"I accept\" button or similar mechanism. If a click-wrap format is not included, you must include a statement that any use (including without limitation reproduction, modification or distribution) of the Software, and any other affirmative act that you define, constitutes acceptance of the License, and instructing the user not to use the Covered Code in any manner if the user does not accept all of the terms and conditions of the License.\r\n\r\n2.2 You may use, reproduce, display, perform, modify and Deploy Covered Code, provided that in each instance:\r\n(a) You must satisfy all the conditions of Section 2.1 with respect to the Source Code of the Covered Code; \r\n(b) You must duplicate, to the extent it does not already exist, the notice in Exhibit A in each file of the Source Code of all Your Modifications, and cause the modified files to carry prominent notices stating that You changed the files and the date of any change; \r\n(c) You must make Source Code of all Your Deployed Modifications publicly available under the terms of this License, including the license grants set forth in Section 3 below, for as long as you Deploy the Covered Code or twelve (12) months from the date of initial Deployment, whichever is longer. You should preferably distribute the Source Code of Your Deployed Modifications electronically (e.g. download from a web site); \r\n(d) if You Deploy Covered Code in object code, executable form only, You must include a prominent notice, in the code itself as well as in related documentation, stating that Source Code of the Covered Code is available under the terms of this License with information on how and where to obtain such Source Code; and \r\n(e) the object code form of the Covered Code may be distributed under Your own license agreement, provided that such license agreement contains terms no less protective of Sybase and each Contributor than the terms of this License, and stating that any provisions which differ from this License are offered by You alone and not by any other party.\r\n\r\n2.3 You expressly acknowledge and agree that although Sybase and each Contributor grants the licenses to their respective portions of the Covered Code set forth herein, no assurances are provided by Sybase or any Contributor that the Covered Code does not infringe the patent or other intellectual property rights of any other entity. Sybase and each Contributor disclaim any liability to You for claims brought by any other entity based on infringement of intellectual property rights or otherwise. As a condition to exercising the rights and licenses granted hereunder, You hereby assume sole responsibility to secure any other intellectual property rights needed, if any. For example, if a third party patent license is required to allow You to distribute the Covered Code, it is Your responsibility to acquire that license before distributing the Covered Code.\r\n\r\n3. Your Grants. In consideration of, and as a condition to, the licenses granted to You under this License, You hereby grant to Sybase and all third parties a non-exclusive, royalty-free license, under Your Applicable Patent Rights and other intellectual property rights (other than patent) owned or controlled by You, to use, reproduce, display, perform, modify, distribute and Deploy Your Modifications of the same scope and extent as Sybase's licenses under Sections 2.1 and 2.2.\r\n\r\n4. Larger Works. You may create a Larger Work by combining Covered Code with other code not governed by the terms of this License and distribute the Larger Work as a single product. In each such instance, You must make sure the requirements of this License are fulfilled for the Covered Code or any portion thereof.\r\n\r\n5. Limitations on Patent License. Except as expressly stated in Section 2, no other patent rights, express or implied, are granted by Sybase herein. Modifications and/or Larger Works may require additional patent licenses from Sybase which Sybase may grant in its sole discretion.\r\n\r\n6. Additional Terms. You may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligations and/or other rights consistent with this License (\"Additional Terms\") to one or more recipients of Covered Code. However, You may do so only on Your own behalf and as Your sole responsibility, and not on behalf of Sybase or any Contributor. You must obtain the recipient's agreement that any such Additional Terms are offered by You alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify, defend and hold Sybase and every Contributor harmless for any liability incurred by or claims asserted against Sybase or such Contributor by reason of any such Additional Terms.\r\n\r\n7. Versions of the License. Sybase may publish revised and/or new versions of this License from time to time. Each version will be given a distinguishing version number. Once Original Code has been published under a particular version of this License, You may continue to use it under the terms of that version. You may also choose to use such Original Code under the terms of any subsequent version of this License published by Sybase. No one other than Sybase has the right to modify the terms applicable to Covered Code created under this License.\r\n\r\n8. NO WARRANTY OR SUPPORT. The Covered Code may contain in whole or in part pre-release, untested, or not fully tested works. The Covered Code may contain errors that could cause failures or loss of data, and may be incomplete or contain inaccuracies. You expressly acknowledge and agree that use of the Covered Code, or any portion thereof, is at Your sole and entire risk. THE COVERED CODE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\" AND WITHOUT WARRANTY, UPGRADES OR SUPPORT OF ANY KIND AND SYBASE AND SYBASE'S LICENSOR(S) (COLLECTIVELY REFERRED TO AS \"SYBASE\" FOR THE PURPOSES OF SECTIONS 8 AND 9) AND ALL CONTRIBUTORS EXPRESSLY DISCLAIM ALL WARRANTIES AND/OR CONDITIONS, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES AND/OR CONDITIONS OF MERCHANTABILITY, OF SATISFACTORY QUALITY, OF FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, OF ACCURACY, OF QUIET ENJOYMENT, AND NONINFRINGEMENT OF THIRD PARTY RIGHTS. SYBASE AND EACH CONTRIBUTOR DOES NOT WARRANT AGAINST INTERFERENCE WITH YOUR ENJOYMENT OF THE COVERED CODE, THAT THE FUNCTIONS CONTAINED IN THE COVERED CODE WILL MEET YOUR REQUIREMENTS, THAT THE OPERATION OF THE COVERED CODE WILL BE UNINTERRUPTED OR ERROR-FREE, OR THAT DEFECTS IN THE COVERED CODE WILL BE CORRECTED. NO ORAL OR WRITTEN INFORMATION OR ADVICE GIVEN BY SYBASE, A SYBASE AUTHORIZED REPRESENTATIVE OR ANY CONTRIBUTOR SHALL CREATE A WARRANTY. You acknowledge that the Covered Code is not intended for use in the operation of nuclear facilities, aircraft navigation, communication systems, or air traffic control machines in which case the failure of the Covered Code could lead to death, personal injury, or severe physical or environmental damage.\r\n\r\n9. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY. TO THE EXTENT NOT PROHIBITED BY LAW, IN NO EVENT SHALL SYBASE OR ANY CONTRIBUTOR BE LIABLE FOR ANY DIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL OR OTHER DAMAGES OF ANY KIND ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS LICENSE OR YOUR USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE COVERED CODE, OR ANY PORTION THEREOF, WHETHER UNDER A THEORY OF CONTRACT, WARRANTY, TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), PRODUCTS LIABILITY OR OTHERWISE, EVEN IF SYBASE OR SUCH CONTRIBUTOR HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES, AND NOTWITHSTANDING THE FAILURE OF ESSENTIAL PURPOSE OF ANY REMEDY. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE LIMITATION OF LIABILITY OF INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL OR OTHER DAMAGES OF ANY KIND, SO THIS LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU. In no event shall Sybase's or any Contributor's total liability to You for all damages (other than as may be required by applicable law) under this License exceed the amount of five hundred dollars ($500.00).\r\n\r\n10. Trademarks. This License does not grant any rights to use the trademarks or trade names \"Sybase\" or any other trademarks or trade names belonging to Sybase (collectively \"Sybase Marks\") or to any trademark or trade name belonging to any Contributor(\"Contributor Marks\"). No Sybase Marks or Contributor Marks may be used to endorse or promote products derived from the Original Code or Covered Code other than with the prior written consent of Sybase or the Contributor, as applicable.\r\n\r\n11. Ownership. Subject to the licenses granted under this License, each Contributor retains all rights, title and interest in and to any Modifications made by such Contributor. Sybase retains all rights, title and interest in and to the Original Code and any Modifications made by or on behalf of Sybase (\"Sybase Modifications\"), and such Sybase Modifications will not be automatically subject to this License. Sybase may, at its sole discretion, choose to license such Sybase Modifications under this License, or on different terms from those contained in this License or may choose not to license them at all.\r\n\r\n12. Termination.\r\n\r\n12.1 Termination. This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate:\r\n(a) automatically without notice if You fail to comply with any term(s) of this License and fail to cure such breach within 30 days of becoming aware of such breach;\r\n(b) immediately in the event of the circumstances described in Section 13.5(b); or\r\n(c) automatically without notice if You, at any time during the term of this License, commence an action for patent infringement (including as a cross claim or counterclaim) against Sybase or any Contributor.\r\n\r\n12.2 Effect of Termination. Upon termination, You agree to immediately stop any further use, reproduction, modification, sublicensing and distribution of the Covered Code and to destroy all copies of the Covered Code that are in your possession or control. All sublicenses to the Covered Code that have been properly granted prior to termination shall survive any termination of this License. Provisions which, by their nature, should remain in effect beyond the termination of this License shall survive, including but not limited to Sections 3, 5, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12.2 and 13. No party will be liable to any other for compensation, indemnity or damages of any sort solely as a result of terminating this License in accordance with its terms, and termination of this License will be without prejudice to any other right or remedy of any party.\r\n\r\n13. Miscellaneous.\r\n\r\n13.1 Government End Users. The Covered Code is a \"commercial item\" as defined in FAR 2.101. Government software and technical data rights in the Covered Code include only those rights customarily provided to the public as defined in this License. This customary commercial license in technical data and software is provided in accordance with FAR 12.211 (Technical Data) and 12.212 (Computer Software) and, for Department of Defense purchases, DFAR 252.227-7015 (Technical Data -- Commercial Items) and 227.7202-3 (Rights in Commercial Computer Software or Computer Software Documentation). Accordingly, all U.S. Government End Users acquire Covered Code with only those rights set forth herein.\r\n\r\n13.2 Relationship of Parties. This License will not be construed as creating an agency, partnership, joint venture or any other form of legal association between or among you, Sybase or any Contributor, and You will not represent to the contrary, whether expressly, by implication, appearance or otherwise.\r\n\r\n13.3 Independent Development. Nothing in this License will impair Sybase's or any Contributor's right to acquire, license, develop, have others develop for it, market and/or distribute technology or products that perform the same or similar functions as, or otherwise compete with, Modifications, Larger Works, technology or products that You may develop, produce, market or distribute.\r\n\r\n13.4 Waiver; Construction. Failure by Sybase or any Contributor to enforce any provision of this License will not be deemed a waiver of future enforcement of that or any other provision. Any law or regulation which provides that the language of a contract shall be construed against the drafter will not apply to this License.\r\n\r\n13.5 Severability. (a) If for any reason a court of competent jurisdiction finds any provision of this License, or portion thereof, to be unenforceable, that provision of the License will be enforced to the maximum extent permissible so as to effect the economic benefits and intent of the parties, and the remainder of this License will continue in full force and effect. (b) Notwithstanding the foregoing, if applicable law prohibits or restricts You from fully and/or specifically complying with Sections 2 and/or 3 or prevents the enforceability of either of those Sections, this License will immediately terminate and You must immediately discontinue any use of the Covered Code and destroy all copies of it that are in your possession or control.\r\n\r\n13.6 Dispute Resolution. Any litigation or other dispute resolution between You and Sybase relating to this License shall take place in the Northern District of California, and You and Sybase hereby consent to the personal jurisdiction of, and venue in, the state and federal courts within that District with respect to this License. The application of the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods is expressly excluded.\r\n\r\n13.7 Entire Agreement; Governing Law. This License constitutes the entire agreement between the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof. This License shall be governed by the laws of the United States and the State of California, except that body of California law concerning conflicts of law. Where You are located in the province of Quebec, Canada, the following clause applies: The parties hereby confirm that they have requested that this License and all related documents be drafted in English. Les parties ont exigè que le prèsent contrat et tous les documents connexes soient rèdiès en anglais.\r\n\r\nEXHIBIT A. \r\n\"Portions Copyright (c) 1983-2002 Sybase, Inc. All Rights Reserved.

ANY USE, REPRODUCTION OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM CONSTITUTES RECIPIENT'S ACCEPTANCE OF THIS AGREEMENT.\r\n\r\n1.

A Contribution 'originates' from a Contributor if it was added to the Program by such Contributor itself or anyone acting on such Contributor's behalf. Contributions do not include additions to the Program which: (i) are separate modules of software distributed in conjunction with the Program under their own license agreement, and (ii) are not derivative works of the Program.\r\n\r\n\"Contributor\" means any person or entity that distributes the Program.\r\n\r\n\"Licensed Patents \" mean patent claims licensable by a Contributor which are necessarily infringed by the use or sale of its Contribution alone or when combined with the Program.\r\n\r\n\"Program\" means the Contributions distributed in accordance with this Agreement.\r\n\r\n\"Recipient\" means anyone who receives the Program under this Agreement, including all Contributors.\r\n\r\n2. GRANT OF RIGHTS\r\n\r\na) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby grants Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free copyright license to reproduce, prepare derivative works of, publicly display, publicly perform, distribute and sublicense the Contribution of such Contributor, if any, and such derivative works, in source code and object code form.\r\n\r\nb) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby grants Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free patent license under Licensed Patents to make, use, sell, offer to sell, import and otherwise transfer the Contribution of such Contributor, if any, in source code and object code form. This patent license shall apply to the combination of the Contribution and the Program if, at the time the Contribution is added by the Contributor, such addition of the Contribution causes such combination to be covered by the Licensed Patents. The patent license shall not apply to any other combinations which include the Contribution. No hardware per se is licensed hereunder.\r\n\r\nc) Recipient understands that although each Contributor grants the licenses to its Contributions set forth herein, no assurances are provided by any Contributor that the Program does not infringe the patent or other intellectual property rights of any other entity. Each Contributor disclaims any liability to Recipient for claims brought by any other entity based on infringement of intellectual property rights or otherwise. As a condition to exercising the rights and licenses granted hereunder, each Recipient hereby assumes sole responsibility to secure any other intellectual property rights needed, if any. For example, if a third party patent license is required to allow Recipient to distribute the Program, it is Recipient's responsibility to acquire that license before distributing the Program.\r\n\r\nd) Each Contributor represents that to its knowledge it has sufficient copyright rights in its Contribution, if any, to grant the copyright license set forth in this Agreement.\r\n\r\n3. REQUIREMENTS\r\n\r\nA Contributor may choose to distribute the Program in object code form under its own license agreement, provided that:\r\n\r\na) it complies with the terms and conditions of this Agreement; and\r\n\r\nb) its license agreement:\r\n\r\ni) effectively disclaims on behalf of all Contributors all warranties and conditions, express and implied, including warranties or conditions of title and non-infringement, and implied warranties or conditions of merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose;\r\n\r\nii) effectively excludes on behalf of all Contributors all liability for damages, including direct, indirect, special, incidental and consequential damages, such as lost profits;\r\n\r\niii) states that any provisions which differ from this Agreement are offered by that Contributor alone and not by any other party; and\r\n\r\niv) states that source code for the Program is available from such Contributor, and informs licensees how to obtain it in a reasonable manner on or through a medium customarily used for software exchange.\r\n\r\nWhen the Program is made available in source code form:\r\n\r\na) it must be made available under this Agreement; and\r\n\r\nb) a copy of this Agreement must be included with each copy of the Program.\r\n\r\nContributors may not remove or alter any copyright notices contained within the Program.\r\n\r\nEach Contributor must identify itself as the originator of its Contribution, if any, in a manner that reasonably allows subsequent Recipients to identify the originator of the Contribution.\r\n\r\n4. COMMERCIAL DISTRIBUTION\r\n\r\nCommercial distributors of software may accept certain responsibilities with respect to end users, business partners and the like. While this license is intended to facilitate the commercial use of the Program, the Contributor who includes the Program in a commercial product offering should do so in a manner which does not create potential liability for other Contributors. Therefore, if a Contributor includes the Program in a commercial product offering, such Contributor (\"Commercial Contributor\") hereby agrees to defend and indemnify every other Contributor (\"Indemnified Contributor\") against any losses, damages and costs (collectively \"Losses\") arising from claims, lawsuits and other legal actions brought by a third party against the Indemnified Contributor to the extent caused by the acts or omissions of such Commercial Contributor in connection with its distribution of the Program in a commercial product offering. The obligations in this section do not apply to any claims or Losses relating to any actual or alleged intellectual property infringement. In order to qualify, an Indemnified Contributor must: a) promptly notify the Commercial Contributor in writing of such claim, and b) allow the Commercial Contributor to control, and cooperate with the Commercial Contributor in, the defense and any related settlement negotiations. The Indemnified Contributor may participate in any such claim at its own expense.\r\n\r\nFor example, a Contributor might include the Program in a commercial product offering, Product X. That Contributor is then a Commercial Contributor. If that Commercial Contributor then makes performance claims, or offers warranties related to Product X, those performance claims and warranties are such Commercial Contributor's responsibility alone. Under this section, the Commercial Contributor would have to defend claims against the other Contributors related to those performance claims and warranties, and if a court requires any other Contributor to pay any damages as a result, the Commercial Contributor must pay those damages.\r\n\r\n5. NO WARRANTY\r\n\r\nEXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, THE PROGRAM IS PROVIDED ON AN \"AS IS\" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. Each Recipient is solely responsible for determining the appropriateness of using and distributing the Program and assumes all risks associated with its exercise of rights under this Agreement, including but not limited to the risks and costs of program errors, compliance with applicable laws, damage to or loss of data, programs or equipment, and unavailability or interruption of operations.\r\n\r\n6. DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY\r\n\r\nEXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, NEITHER RECIPIENT NOR ANY CONTRIBUTORS SHALL HAVE ANY LIABILITY FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES (INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION LOST PROFITS), HOWEVER CAUSED AND ON ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY, WHETHER IN CONTRACT, STRICT LIABILITY, OR TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE OR OTHERWISE) ARISING IN ANY WAY OUT OF THE USE OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM OR THE EXERCISE OF ANY RIGHTS GRANTED HEREUNDER, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.\r\n\r\n7. GENERAL\r\n\r\nIf any provision of this Agreement is invalid or unenforceable under applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of the remainder of the terms of this Agreement, and without further action by the parties hereto, such provision shall be reformed to the minimum extent necessary to make such provision valid and enforceable.\r\n\r\nIf Recipient institutes patent litigation against a Contributor with respect to a patent applicable to software (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit), then any patent licenses granted by that Contributor to such Recipient under this Agreement shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed. In addition, if Recipient institutes patent litigation against any entity (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Program itself (excluding combinations of the Program with other software or hardware) infringes such Recipient's patent(s), then such Recipient's rights granted under Section 2(b) shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed.\r\n\r\nAll Recipient's rights under this Agreement shall terminate if it fails to comply with any of the material terms or conditions of this Agreement and does not cure such failure in a reasonable period of time after becoming aware of such noncompliance. If all Recipient's rights under this Agreement terminate, Recipient agrees to cease use and distribution of the Program as soon as reasonably practicable. However, Recipient's obligations under this Agreement and any licenses granted by Recipient relating to the Program shall continue and survive.\r\n\r\nEveryone is permitted to copy and distribute copies of this Agreement, but in order to avoid inconsistency the Agreement is copyrighted and may only be modified in the following manner. The Agreement Steward reserves the right to publish new versions (including revisions) of this Agreement from time to time. No one other than the Agreement Steward has the right to modify this Agreement. IBM is the initial Agreement Steward. IBM may assign the responsibility to serve as the Agreement Steward to a suitable separate entity. Each new version of the Agreement will be given a distinguishing version number. The Program (including Contributions) may always be distributed subject to the version of the Agreement under which it was received. In addition, after a new version of the Agreement is published, Contributor may elect to distribute the Program (including its Contributions) under the new version. Except as expressly stated in Sections 2(a) and 2(b) above, Recipient receives no rights or licenses to the intellectual property of any Contributor under this Agreement, whether expressly, by implication, estoppel or otherwise. All rights in the Program not expressly granted under this Agreement are reserved.\r\n\r\nThis Agreement is governed by the laws of the State of New York and the intellectual property laws of the United States of America. No party to this Agreement will bring a legal action under this Agreement more than one year after the cause of action arose. Each party waives its rights to a jury trial in any resulting litigation.", notes: "", similar_license_id: 85},

The patent license granted by a Contributor shall also apply to the combination of the Contribution of that Contributor and the Program if, at the time the Contribution is added by the Contributor, such addition of the Contribution causes such combination to be covered by the Licensed Patents. The patent license granted by a Contributor shall not apply to (i) any other combinations which include the Contribution, nor to (ii) Contributions of other Contributors. No hardware per se is licensed hereunder.\r\nRecipient understands that although each Contributor grants the licenses to its Contributions set forth herein, no assurances are provided by any Contributor that the Program does not infringe the patent or other intellectual property rights of any other entity. Each Contributor disclaims any liability to Recipient for claims brought by any other entity based on infringement of intellectual property rights or otherwise. As a condition to exercising the rights and licenses granted hereunder, each Recipient hereby assumes sole responsibility to secure any other intellectual property rights needed, if any. For example, if a third party patent license is required to allow Recipient to distribute the Program, it is Recipient's responsibility to acquire that license before distributing the Program.\r\nEach Contributor represents that to its knowledge it has sufficient copyright rights in its Contribution, if any, to grant the copyright license set forth in this Agreement.\r\n3. REQUIREMENTS\r\nA. Distributor may choose to distribute the Program in any form under this Agreement or under its own license agreement, provided that:\r\n\r\nit complies with the terms and conditions of this Agreement;\r\nif the Program is distributed in source code or other tangible form, a copy of this Agreement or Distributor's own license agreement is included with each copy of the Program; and\r\nif distributed under Distributor's own license agreement, such license agreement:\r\neffectively disclaims on behalf of all Contributors all warranties and conditions, express and implied, including warranties or conditions of title and non-infringement, and implied warranties or conditions of merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose;\r\neffectively excludes on behalf of all Contributors all liability for damages, including direct, indirect, special, incidental and consequential damages, such as lost profits; and\r\nstates that any provisions which differ from this Agreement are offered by that Contributor alone and not by any other party.\r\nB. Each Distributor must include the following in a conspicuous location in the Program:\r\n\r\nCopyright (C) <YEAR>, <ORGANIZATION> and others. All Rights Reserved.\r\nC. In addition, each Contributor must identify itself as the originator of its Contribution, if any, and indicate its consent to characterization of its additions and/or changes as a Contribution, in a manner that reasonably allows subsequent Recipients to identify the originator of the Contribution. Once consent is granted, it may not thereafter be revoked.\r\n\r\n4. COMMERCIAL DISTRIBUTION\r\nCommercial distributors of software may accept certain responsibilities with respect to end users, business partners and the like. While this license is intended to facilitate the commercial use of the Program, the Distributor who includes the Program in a commercial product offering should do so in a manner which does not create potential liability for Contributors. Therefore, if a Distributor includes the Program in a commercial product offering, such Distributor (\"Commercial Distributor\") hereby agrees to defend and indemnify every Contributor (\"Indemnified Contributor\") against any losses, damages and costs (collectively \"Losses\") arising from claims, lawsuits and other legal actions brought by a third party against the Indemnified Contributor to the extent caused by the acts or omissions of such Commercial Distributor in connection with its distribution of the Program in a commercial product offering. The obligations in this section do not apply to any claims or Losses relating to any actual or alleged intellectual property infringement. In order to qualify, an Indemnified Contributor must: a) promptly notify the Commercial Distributor in writing of such claim, and b) allow the Commercial Distributor to control, and cooperate with the Commercial Distributor in, the defense and any related settlement negotiations. The Indemnified Contributor may participate in any such claim at its own expense.\r\n\r\nFor example, a Distributor might include the Program in a commercial product offering, Product X. That Distributor is then a Commercial Distributor. If that Commercial Distributor then makes performance claims, or offers warranties related to Product X, those performance claims and warranties are such Commercial Distributor's responsibility alone. Under this section, the Commercial Distributor would have to defend claims against the Contributors related to those performance claims and warranties, and if a court requires any Contributor to pay any damages as a result, the Commercial Distributor must pay those damages.\r\n\r\n5. NO WARRANTY\r\nEXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, THE PROGRAM IS PROVIDED ON AN \"AS IS\" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. Each Recipient is solely responsible for determining the appropriateness of using and distributing the Program and assumes all risks associated with its exercise of rights under this Agreement, including but not limited to the risks and costs of program errors, compliance with applicable laws, damage to or loss of data, programs or equipment, and unavailability or interruption of operations.\r\n\r\n6. DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY\r\nEXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, NEITHER RECIPIENT NOR ANY CONTRIBUTORS SHALL HAVE ANY LIABILITY FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES (INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION LOST PROFITS), HOWEVER CAUSED AND ON ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY, WHETHER IN CONTRACT, STRICT LIABILITY, OR TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE OR OTHERWISE) ARISING IN ANY WAY OUT OF THE USE OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM OR THE EXERCISE OF ANY RIGHTS GRANTED HEREUNDER, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.\r\n\r\n7.

LIMITATION OF LIABILITY.\r\nUNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES AND UNDER NO LEGAL THEORY, WHETHER TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), CONTRACT, OR OTHERWISE, SHALL THE INITIAL DEVELOPER, ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR, OR ANY DISTRIBUTOR OF COVERED CODE, OR ANY SUPPLIER OF ANY OF SUCH PARTIES, BE LIABLE TO YOU OR ANY OTHER PERSON FOR ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY CHARACTER INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF GOODWILL, WORK STOPPAGE, COMPUTER FAILURE OR MALFUNCTION, OR ANY AND ALL OTHER COMMERCIAL DAMAGES OR LOSSES, EVEN IF SUCH PARTY SHALL HAVE BEEN INFORMED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. THIS LIMITATION OF LIABILITY SHALL NOT APPLY TO LIABILITY FOR DEATH OR PERSONAL INJURY RESULTING FROM SUCH PARTY'S NEGLIGENCE TO THE EXTENT APPLICABLE LAW PROHIBITS SUCH LIMITATION. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO THAT EXCLUSION AND LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.\r\n10. U.S. GOVERNMENT END USERS.\r\nThe Covered Code is a \"commercial item,\" as that term is defined in 48 C.F.R. 2.101 (Oct. 1995), consisting of \"commercial computer software\" and \"commercial computer software documentation,\" as such terms are used in 48 C.F.R. 12.212 (Sept. 1995).

Except to the extent prohibited by statute or regulation, such description must be sufficiently detailed for a recipient of ordinary skill to be able to understand it.\r\n5. Application of this License.\r\nThis License applies to code to which the Initial Developer has attached the notice in Exhibit A and to related Covered Code.\r\n6. Versions of the License.\r\n6.1. New Versions. \r\nNetscape Communications Corporation (''Netscape'') may publish revised and/or new versions of the License from time to time. Each version will be given a distinguishing version number.\r\n6.2. Effect of New Versions. \r\nOnce Covered Code has been published under a particular version of the License, You may always continue to use it under the terms of that version. You may also choose to use such Covered Code under the terms of any subsequent version of the License published by Netscape. No one other than Netscape has the right to modify the terms applicable to Covered Code created under this License.\r\n\r\n6.3. Derivative Works. \r\nIf You create or use a modified version of this License (which you may only do in order to apply it to code which is not already Covered Code governed by this License), You must (a) rename Your license so that the phrases ''Mozilla'', ''MOZILLAPL'', ''MOZPL'', ''Netscape'', \"MPL\", ''NPL'' or any confusingly similar phrase do not appear in your license (except to note that your license differs from this License) and (b) otherwise make it clear that Your version of the license contains terms which differ from the Mozilla Public License and Netscape Public License. (Filling in the name of the Initial Developer, Original Code or Contributor in the notice described in Exhibit A shall not of themselves be deemed to be modifications of this License.)\r\n\r\n7. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY.\r\nCOVERED CODE IS PROVIDED UNDER THIS LICENSE ON AN \"AS IS'' BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES THAT THE COVERED CODE IS FREE OF DEFECTS, MERCHANTABLE, FIT FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR NON-INFRINGING. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE COVERED CODE IS WITH YOU. SHOULD ANY COVERED CODE PROVE DEFECTIVE IN ANY RESPECT, YOU (NOT THE INITIAL DEVELOPER OR ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR) ASSUME THE COST OF ANY NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION. THIS DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY CONSTITUTES AN ESSENTIAL PART OF THIS LICENSE. NO USE OF ANY COVERED CODE IS AUTHORIZED HEREUNDER EXCEPT UNDER THIS DISCLAIMER.\r\n8. TERMINATION.\r\n8.1.  This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate automatically if You fail to comply with terms herein and fail to cure such breach within 30 days of becoming aware of the breach. All sublicenses to the Covered Code which are properly granted shall survive any termination of this License. Provisions which, by their nature, must remain in effect beyond the termination of this License shall survive.\r\n8.2.  If You initiate litigation by asserting a patent infringement claim (excluding declatory judgment actions) against Initial Developer or a Contributor (the Initial Developer or Contributor against whom You file such action is referred to as \"Participant\")  alleging that:\r\n\r\n(a)  such Participant's Contributor Version directly or indirectly infringes any patent, then any and all rights granted by such Participant to You under Sections 2.1 and/or 2.2 of this License shall, upon 60 days notice from Participant terminate prospectively, unless if within 60 days after receipt of notice You either: (i)  agree in writing to pay Participant a mutually agreeable reasonable royalty for Your past and future use of Modifications made by such Participant, or (ii) withdraw Your litigation claim with respect to the Contributor Version against such Participant.  If within 60 days of notice, a reasonable royalty and payment arrangement are not mutually agreed upon in writing by the parties or the litigation claim is not withdrawn, the rights granted by Participant to You under Sections 2.1 and/or 2.2 automatically terminate at the expiration of the 60 day notice period specified above.\r\n\r\n(b)  any software, hardware, or device, other than such Participant's Contributor Version, directly or indirectly infringes any patent, then any rights granted to You by such Participant under Sections 2.1(b) and 2.2(b) are revoked effective as of the date You first made, used, sold, distributed, or had made, Modifications made by that Participant.\r\n\r\n8.3.  If You assert a patent infringement claim against Participant alleging that such Participant's Contributor Version directly or indirectly infringes any patent where such claim is resolved (such as by license or settlement) prior to the initiation of patent infringement litigation, then the reasonable value of the licenses granted by such Participant under Sections 2.1 or 2.2 shall be taken into account in determining the amount or value of any payment or license.\r\n\r\n8.4.  In the event of termination under Sections 8.1 or 8.2 above,  all end user license agreements (excluding distributors and resellers) which have been validly granted by You or any distributor hereunder prior to termination shall survive termination.\r\n\r\n9. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY.\r\nUNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES AND UNDER NO LEGAL THEORY, WHETHER TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), CONTRACT, OR OTHERWISE, SHALL YOU, THE INITIAL DEVELOPER, ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR, OR ANY DISTRIBUTOR OF COVERED CODE, OR ANY SUPPLIER OF ANY OF SUCH PARTIES, BE LIABLE TO ANY PERSON FOR ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY CHARACTER INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF GOODWILL, WORK STOPPAGE, COMPUTER FAILURE OR MALFUNCTION, OR ANY AND ALL OTHER COMMERCIAL DAMAGES OR LOSSES, EVEN IF SUCH PARTY SHALL HAVE BEEN INFORMED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. THIS LIMITATION OF LIABILITY SHALL NOT APPLY TO LIABILITY FOR DEATH OR PERSONAL INJURY RESULTING FROM SUCH PARTY'S NEGLIGENCE TO THE EXTENT APPLICABLE LAW PROHIBITS SUCH LIMITATION. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO THIS EXCLUSION AND LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.\r\n10. U.S. GOVERNMENT END USERS.\r\nThe Covered Code is a ''commercial item,'' as that term is defined in 48 C.F.R. 2.101 (Oct. 1995), consisting of ''commercial computer software'' and ''commercial computer software documentation,'' as such terms are used in 48 C.F.R. 12.212 (Sept. 1995). Consistent with 48 C.F.R. 12.212 and 48 C.F.R. 227.7202-1 through 227.7202-4 (June 1995), all U.S. Government End Users acquire Covered Code with only those rights set forth herein.\r\n11. MISCELLANEOUS.\r\nThis License represents the complete agreement concerning subject matter hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be unenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only to the extent necessary to make it enforceable. This License shall be governed by California law provisions (except to the extent applicable law, if any, provides otherwise), excluding its conflict-of-law provisions. With respect to disputes in which at least one party is a citizen of, or an entity chartered or registered to do business in the United States of America, any litigation relating to this License shall be subject to the jurisdiction of the Federal Courts of the Northern District of California, with venue lying in Santa Clara County, California, with the losing party responsible for costs, including without limitation, court costs and reasonable attorneys' fees and expenses. The application of the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods is expressly excluded. Any law or regulation which provides that the language of a contract shall be construed against the drafter shall not apply to this License.\r\n12. RESPONSIBILITY FOR CLAIMS.\r\nAs between Initial Developer and the Contributors, each party is responsible for claims and damages arising, directly or indirectly, out of its utilization of rights under this License and You agree to work with Initial Developer and Contributors to distribute such responsibility on an equitable basis. Nothing herein is intended or shall be deemed to constitute any admission of liability.\r\n13. MULTIPLE-LICENSED CODE.\r\nInitial Developer may designate portions of the Covered Code as Multiple-Licensed.  Multiple-Licensed means that the Initial Developer permits you to utilize portions of the Covered Code under Your choice of the MPL or the alternative licenses, if any, specified by the Initial Developer in the file described in Exhibit A.\r\n\r\nEXHIBIT A -Mozilla Public License.\r\n\r\n``The contents of this file are subject to the Mozilla Public License Version 1.1 (the \"License\"); you may not use this file except in compliance with the License.

In so naming Your license, You may not use any trademark of Licensor or of any Contributor.

Nothing herein is intended or shall be deemed to constitute any admission of liability.\r\n\r\n12.0 Termination.

If You assert a patent infringement claim against Respondent alleging that Licensed Software directly or indirectly infringes any patent where such claim is resolved (such as by license or settlement) prior to the initiation of patent infringement litigation, then the reasonable value of the licenses granted by said Respondent under Sections 3 and 4 shall be taken into account in determining the amount or value of any payment or license.\r\n\r\n12.4 No Retroactive Effect of Termination. In the event of termination under this Section all end user license agreements (excluding licenses to distributors and resellers) that have been validly granted by You or any distributor hereunder prior to termination shall survive termination.\r\n\r\n13.0 Miscellaneous.\r\n\r\n13.1 U.S. Government End Users.

If you assert any patent claims against the Licensor relating to the Licensed Product, or if you breach any terms of the License, your rights to the Licensed Product under this License automatically terminate.\r\n\r\nYou may use this License to distribute your own Derivative Works, in which case the provisions of this License will apply to your Derivative Works just as they do to the original Licensed Product.\r\n\r\nAlternatively, you may distribute your Derivative Works under any other OSI-approved Open Source license, or under a proprietary license of your choice. If you use any license other than this License, however, you must continue to fulfill the requirements of this License (including the provisions relating to publishing the Source Code) for those portions of your Derivative Works that consist of the Licensed Product, including the files containing Modifications.\r\n\r\nNew versions of this License may be published from time to time. You may choose to continue to use the license terms in this version of the License or those from the new version. However, only the Licensor has the right to change the License terms as they apply to the Licensed Product.\r\n\r\nThis License relies on precise definitions for certain terms. Those terms are defined when they are first used, and the definitions are repeated for your convenience in a Glossary at the end of the License.\r\n\r\nLicense Terms\r\n\r\n1.      Grant of License From Licensor. Licensor hereby grants you a world-wide, royalty-free, non-exclusive license, subject to third party intellectual property claims, to do the following:\r\n\r\na.       Use, reproduce, modify, display, perform, sublicense and distribute any Modifications created by such Contributor or portions thereof, in both Source Code or as an executable program, either on an unmodified basis or as part of Derivative Works.\r\n\r\nb.       Under claims of patents now or hereafter owned or controlled by Contributor, to make, use, sell, offer for sale, have made, and/or otherwise dispose of Modifications or portions thereof, but solely to the extent that any such claim is necessary to enable you to make, use, sell, offer for sale, have made, and/or otherwise dispose of Modifications or portions thereof or Derivative Works thereof.\r\n\r\n2. Grant of License to Modifications From Contributor. \"Modifications\" means any additions to or deletions from the substance or structure of (i) a file containing Licensed Product, or (ii) any new file that contains any part of Licensed Product. Hereinafter in this License, the term \"Licensed Product\" shall include all previous Modifications that you receive from any Contributor. By application of the provisions in Section 4(a) below, each person or entity who created or contributed to the creation of, and distributed, a Modification (a \"Contributor\") hereby grants you a world-wide, royalty-free, non-exclusive license, subject to third party intellectual property claims, to do the following:\r\nUse, reproduce, modify, display, perform, sublicense and distribute any Modifications created by such Contributor or portions thereof, in both Source Code or as an executable program, either on an unmodified basis or as part of Derivative Works.\r\nUnder claims of patents now or hereafter owned or controlled by Contributor, to make, use, sell, offer for sale, have made, and/or otherwise dispose of Modifications or portions thereof, but solely to the extent that any such claim is necessary to enable you to make, use, sell, offer for sale, have made, and/or otherwise dispose of Modifications or portions thereof or Derivative Works thereof.\r\n3.      Exclusions From License Grant. Nothing in this License shall be deemed to grant any rights to trademarks, copyrights, patents, trade secrets or any other intellectual property of Licensor or any Contributor except as expressly stated herein.No patent license is granted separate from the Licensed Product, for code that you delete from the Licensed Product, or for combinations of the Licensed Product with other software or hardware. No right is granted to the trademarks of Licensor or any Contributor even if such marks are included in the Licensed Product. Nothing in this License shall be interpreted to prohibit Licensor from licensing under different terms from this License any code that Licensor otherwise would have a right to license.\r\n\r\n4.      Your Obligations Regarding Distribution.\r\n\r\na.       Application of This License to Your Modifications.As an express condition for your use of the Licensed Product, you hereby agree that any Modifications that you create or to which you contribute, and which you distribute, are governed by the terms of this License including, without limitation, Section 2. Any Modifications that you create or to which you contribute may be distributed only under the terms of this License or a future version of this License released under Section 7. You must include a copy of this License with every copy of the Modifications you distribute. You agree not to offer or impose any terms on any Source Code or executable version of the Licensed Product or Modifications that alter or restrict the applicable version of this License or the recipients' rights hereunder.However, you may include an additional document offering the additional rights described in Section 4(e).\r\n\r\nb.       Availability of Source Code. You must make available, under the terms of this License, the Source Code of the Licensed Product and any Modifications that you distribute, either on the same media as you distribute any executable or other form of the Licensed Product, or via a mechanism generally accepted in the software development community for the electronic transfer of data (an \"Electronic Distribution Mechanism\"). The Source Code for any version of Licensed Product or Modifications that you distribute must remain available for at least twelve (12) months after the date it initially became available, or at least six (6) months after a subsequent version of said Licensed Product or Modifications has been made available. You are responsible for ensuring that the Source Code version remains available even if the Electronic Distribution Mechanism is maintained by a third party.\r\n\r\nc.       Description of Modifications. You must cause any Modifications that you create or to which you contribute, and which you distribute, to contain a file documenting the additions, changes or deletions you made to create or contribute to those Modifications, and the dates of any such additions, changes or deletions. You must include a prominent statement that the Modifications are derived, directly or indirectly, from the Licensed Product and include the names of the Licensor and any Contributor to the Licensed Product in (i) the Source Code and (ii) in any notice displayed by a version of the Licensed Product you distribute or in related documentation in which you describe the origin or ownership of the Licensed Product.You may not modify or delete any preexisting copyright notices in the Licensed Product.\r\n\r\nd.       Intellectual Property Matters.\r\n\r\n                                   i.            Third Party Claims. If you have knowledge that a license to a third party's intellectual property right is required to exercise the rights granted by this License, you must include a text file with the Source Code distribution titled \"LEGAL\" that describes the claim and the party making the claim in sufficient detail that a recipient will know whom to contact. If you obtain such knowledge after you make any Modifications available as described in Section 4(b), you shall promptly modify the LEGAL file in all copies you make available thereafter and shall take other steps (such as notifying appropriate mailing lists or newsgroups) reasonably calculated to inform those who received the Licensed Product from you that new knowledge has been obtained.\r\n\r\n                               ii.            Contributor APIs. If your Modifications include an application programming interface (\"API\") and you have knowledge of patent licenses that are reasonably necessary to implement that API, you must also include this information in the LEGAL file.\r\n\r\n                              iii.            Representations. You represent that, except as disclosed pursuant to 4(d)(i) above, you believe that any Modifications you distribute are your original creations and that you have sufficient rights to grant the rights conveyed by this License.\r\n\r\ne.       Required Notices. You must duplicate this License in any documentation you provide along with the Source Code of any Modifications you create or to which you contribute, and which you distribute, wherever you describe recipients' rights relating to Licensed Product. You must duplicate the notice contained in Exhibit A (the \"Notice\") in each file of the Source Code of any copy you distribute of the Licensed Product.If you created a Modification, you may add your name as a Contributor to the Notice. If it is not possible to put the Notice in a particular Source Code file due to its structure, then you must include such Notice in a location (such as a relevant directory file) where a user would be likely to look for such a notice. You may choose to offer, and charge a fee for, warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligations to one or more recipients of Licensed Product.However, you may do so only on your own behalf, and not on behalf of the Licensor or any Contributor. You must make it clear that any such warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligation is offered by you alone, and you hereby agree to indemnify the Licensor and every Contributor for any liability incurred by the Licensor or such Contributor as a result of warranty, support, indemnity or liability terms you offer.\r\n\r\nf.        Distribution of Executable Versions. You may distribute Licensed Product as an executable program under a license of your choice that may contain terms different from this License provided (i) you have satisfied the requirements of Sections 4(a) through 4(e) for that distribution, (ii) you include a conspicuous notice in the executable version, related documentation and collateral materials stating that the Source Code version of the Licensed Product is available under the terms of this License, including a description of how and where you have fulfilled the obligations of Section 4(b), (iii) you retain all existing copyright notices in the Licensed Product, and (iv) you make it clear that any terms that differ from this License are offered by you alone, not by Licensor or any Contributor. You hereby agree to indemnify the Licensor and every Contributor for any liability incurred by Licensor or such Contributor as a result of any terms you offer.\r\n\r\ng.       Distribution of Derivative Works. You may create Derivative Works (e.g., combinations of some or all of the Licensed Product with other code) and distribute the Derivative Works as products under any other license you select, with the proviso that the requirements of this License are fulfilled for those portions of the Derivative Works that consist of the Licensed Product or any Modifications thereto.\r\n\r\n5.      Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation.If it is impossible for you to comply with any of the terms of this License with respect to some or all of the Licensed Product due to statute, judicial order, or regulation, then you must (i) comply with the terms of this License to the maximum extent possible, (ii) cite the statute or regulation that prohibits you from adhering to the License, and (iii) describe the limitations and the code they affect.Such description must be included in the LEGAL file described in Section 4(d), and must be included with all distributions of the Source Code. Except to the extent prohibited by statute or regulation, such description must be sufficiently detailed for a recipient of ordinary skill at computer programming to be able to understand it.\r\n\r\n6.      Application of This License. This License applies to code to which Licensor or Contributor has attached the Notice in Exhibit A, which is incorporated herein by this reference.\r\n\r\n7.      Versions of This License.\r\n\r\na.       New Versions. Licensor may publish from time to time revised and/or new versions of the License.\r\n\r\nb.       Effect of New Versions. Once Licensed Product has been published under a particular version of the License, you may always continue to use it under the terms of that version. You may also choose to use such Licensed Product under the terms of any subsequent version of the License published by Licensor. No one other than Licensor has the right to modify the terms applicable to Licensed Product created under this License.\r\n\r\nc.       Derivative Works of this License. If you create or use a modified version of this License, which you may do only in order to apply it to software that is not already a Licensed Product under this License, you must rename your license so that it is not confusingly similar to this License, and must make it clear that your license contains terms that differ from this License. In so naming your license, you may not use any trademark of Licensor or any Contributor.\r\n\r\n8.      Disclaimer of Warranty. LICENSED PRODUCT IS PROVIDED UNDER THIS LICENSE ON AN AS IS BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES THAT THE LICENSED PRODUCT IS FREE OF DEFECTS, MERCHANTABLE, FIT FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR NON-INFRINGING.THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE LICENSED PRODUCT IS WITH YOU. SHOULD LICENSED PRODUCT PROVE DEFECTIVE IN ANY RESPECT, YOU (AND NOT THE LICENSOR OR ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR) ASSUME THE COST OF ANY NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION. THIS DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY CONSTITUTES AN ESSENTIAL PART OF THIS LICENSE.NO USE OF LICENSED PRODUCT IS AUTHORIZED HEREUNDER EXCEPT UNDER THIS DISCLAIMER.\r\n\r\n9.      Termination.\r\n\r\na.       Automatic Termination Upon Breach. This license and the rights granted hereunder will terminate automatically if you fail to comply with the terms herein and fail to cure such breach within thirty (30) days of becoming aware of the breach. All sublicenses to the Licensed Product that are properly granted shall survive any termination of this license. Provisions that, by their nature, must remain in effect beyond the termination of this License, shall survive.\r\n\r\nb.       Termination Upon Assertion of Patent Infringement.If you initiate litigation by asserting a patent infringement claim (excluding declaratory judgment actions) against Licensor or a Contributor (Licensor or Contributor against whom you file such an action is referred to herein as Respondent) alleging that Licensed Product directly or indirectly infringes any patent, then any and all rights granted by such Respondent to you under Sections 1 or 2 of this License shall terminate prospectively upon sixty (60) days notice from Respondent (the \"Notice Period\") unless within that Notice Period you either agree in writing (i) to pay Respondent a mutually agreeable reasonably royalty for your past or future use of Licensed Product made by such Respondent, or (ii) withdraw your litigation claim with respect to Licensed Product against such Respondent. If within said Notice Period a reasonable royalty and payment arrangement are not mutually agreed upon in writing by the parties or the litigation claim is not withdrawn, the rights granted by Licensor to you under Sections 1 and 2 automatically terminate at the expiration of said Notice Period.\r\n\r\nc.       Reasonable Value of This License. If you assert a patent infringement claim against Respondent alleging that Licensed Product directly or indirectly infringes any patent where such claim is resolved (such as by license or settlement) prior to the initiation of patent infringement litigation, then the reasonable value of the licenses granted by said Respondent under Sections 1 and 2 shall be taken into account in determining the amount or value of any payment or license.\r\n\r\nd.       No Retroactive Effect of Termination. In the event of termination under Sections 9(a) or 9(b) above, all end user license agreements (excluding licenses to distributors and resellers) that have been validly granted by you or any distributor hereunder prior to termination shall survive termination.\r\n\r\n10.  Limitation of Liability. UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES AND UNDER NO LEGAL THEORY, WHETHER TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), CONTRACT, OR OTHERWISE, SHALL THE LICENSOR, ANY CONTRIBUTOR, OR ANY DISTRIBUTOR OF LICENSED PRODUCT, OR ANY SUPPLIER OF ANY OF SUCH PARTIES, BE LIABLE TO ANY PERSON FOR ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY CHARACTER INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF GOODWILL, WORK STOPPAGE, COMPUTER FAILURE OR MALFUNCTION, OR ANY AND ALL OTHER COMMERCIAL DAMAGES OR LOSSES, EVEN IF SUCH PARTY SHALL HAVE BEEN INFORMED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. THIS LIMITATION OF LIABILITY SHALL NOT APPLY TO LIABILITY FOR DEATH OR PERSONAL INJURY RESULTING FROM SUCH PARTYS NEGLIGENCE TO THE EXTENT APPLICABLE LAW PROHIBITS SUCH LIMITATION. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO THIS EXCLUSION AND LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.\r\n\r\n11.  Responsibility for Claims. As between Licensor and Contributors, each party is responsible for claims and damages arising, directly or indirectly, out of its utilization of rights under this License. You agree to work with Licensor and Contributors to distribute such responsibility on an equitable basis. Nothing herein is intended or shall be deemed to constitute any admission of liability.\r\n\r\n12.  U.S. Government End Users. The Licensed Product is a commercial item, as that term is defined in 48 C.F.R. 2.101 (Oct. 1995), consisting of commercial computer software and commercial computer software documentation, as such terms are used in 48 C.F.R. 12.212 (Sept. 1995). Consistent with 48 C.F.R. 12.212 and 48 C.F.R. 227.7202-1 through 227.7202-4 (June 1995), all U.S. Government End Users acquire Licensed Product with only those rights set forth herein.\r\n\r\n13.  Miscellaneous. This License represents the complete agreement concerning the subject matter hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be unenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only to the extent necessary to make it enforceable. This License shall be governed by California law provisions (except to the extent applicable law, if any, provides otherwise), excluding its conflict-of-law provisions. You expressly agree that any litigation relating to this license shall be subject to the jurisdiction of the Federal Courts of the Northern District of California or the Superior Court of the County of Santa Clara, California (as appropriate), with venue lying in Santa Clara County, California, with the losing party responsible for costs including, without limitation, court costs and reasonable attorneys fees and expenses. The application of the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods is expressly excluded. You and Licensor expressly waive any rights to a jury trial in any litigation concerning Licensed Product or this License. Any law or regulation that provides that the language of a contract shall be construed against the drafter shall not apply to this License.\r\n\r\n14.  Definition of You in This License.You throughout this License, whether in upper or lower case, means an individual or a legal entity exercising rights under, and complying with all of the terms of, this License or a future version of this License issued under Section 7. For legal entities, you includes any entity that controls, is controlled by, or is under common control with you. For purposes of this definition, control means (i) the power, direct or indirect, to cause the direction or management of such entity, whether by contract or otherwise, or (ii) ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the outstanding shares, or (iii) beneficial ownership of such entity.\r\n\r\n15.

By contrast, the GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free software--to make sure the software is free for all its users. This General Public License applies to most of the Free Software Foundation's software and to any other program whose authors commit to using it. (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered by the GNU Library General Public License instead.) You can apply it to your programs, too.\r\n\r\nWhen we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price. Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.\r\n\r\nTo protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights. These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.\r\n\r\nFor example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that you have. You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code. And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.\r\n\r\nWe protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and (2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the software.\r\n\r\nAlso, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free software. If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original authors' reputations.\r\n\r\nFinally, any free program is threatened constantly by software patents. We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free program will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the program proprietary. To prevent this, we have made it clear that any patent must be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.\r\n\r\nThe precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modification follow.\r\n\r\nTERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION\r\n0.\r\n\r\nThis License applies to any program or other work which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed under the terms of this General Public License. The \"Program\", below, refers to any such program or work, and a \"work based on the Program\" means either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another language. (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in the term \"modification\".) Each licensee is addressed as \"you\".\r\nActivities other than copying, distribution and modification are not covered by this License; they are outside its scope. The act of running the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the Program (independent of having been made by running the Program). Whether that is true depends on what the Program does.\r\n\r\n1.\r\n\r\nYou may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty; and give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License along with the Program.\r\nYou may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.\r\n\r\n2.\r\n\r\nYou may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion of it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1 above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:\r\na)\r\nYou must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.\r\nb)\r\nYou must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third parties under the terms of this License.\r\nc)\r\nIf the modified program normally reads commands interactively when run, you must cause it, when started running for such interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this License. (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but does not normally print such an announcement, your work based on the Program is not required to print an announcement.)\r\nThese requirements apply to the modified work as a whole. If identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program, and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those sections when you distribute them as separate works. But when you distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based on the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.\r\n\r\nThus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or collective works based on the Program.\r\n\r\nIn addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under the scope of this License.\r\n\r\n3.\r\n\r\nYou may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:\r\na)\r\nAccompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,\r\nb)\r\nAccompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,\r\nc)\r\nAccompany it with the information you received as to the offer to distribute corresponding source code. (This alternative is allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you received the program in object code or executable form with such an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)\r\nThe source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for making modifications to it. For an executable work, complete source code means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation and installation of the executable. However, as a special exception, the source code distributed need not include anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies the executable.\r\n\r\nIf distribution of executable or object code is made by offering access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the source code from the same place counts as distribution of the source code, even though third parties are not compelled to copy the source along with the object code.\r\n\r\n4.\r\n\r\nYou may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program except as expressly provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License. However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.\r\n5.\r\n\r\nYou are not required to accept this License, since you have not signed it. However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or distribute the Program or its derivative works. These actions are prohibited by law if you do not accept this License. Therefore, by modifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying the Program or works based on it.\r\n6.\r\n\r\nEach time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to these terms and conditions. You may not impose any further restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein. You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to this License.\r\n7.\r\n\r\nIf, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues), conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not excuse you from the conditions of this License. If you cannot distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may not distribute the Program at all. For example, if a patent license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to refrain entirely from distribution of the Program.\r\nIf any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.\r\n\r\nIt is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the integrity of the free software distribution system, which is implemented by public license practices. Many people have made generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed through that system in reliance on consistent application of that system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot impose that choice.\r\n\r\nThis section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to be a consequence of the rest of this License.\r\n\r\n8.\r\n\r\nIf the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the original copyright holder who places the Program under this License may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus excluded. In such case, this License incorporates the limitation as if written in the body of this License.\r\n9.\r\n\r\nThe Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of the General Public License from time to time. Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.\r\nEach version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Program specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and \"any later version\", you have the option of following the terms and conditions either of that version or of any later version published by the Free Software Foundation. If the Program does not specify a version number of this License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software Foundation.\r\n\r\n10.\r\n\r\nIf you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author to ask for permission. For software which is copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this. Our decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.\r\nNO WARRANTY\r\n11.\r\n\r\nBECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM \"AS IS\" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.\r\n12.\r\n\r\nIN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.\r\nEND OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\r\nHow to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs\r\nIf you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.\r\n\r\nTo do so, attach the following notices to the program. It is safest to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the \"copyright\" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.\r\n\r\none line to give the program's name and an idea of what it does.\r\nCopyright (C) yyyy  name of author\r\n\r\nThis program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or\r\nmodify it under the terms of the GNU General Public License\r\nas published by the Free Software Foundation; either version 2\r\nof the License, or (at your option) any later version.\r\n\r\nThis program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,\r\nbut WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of\r\nMERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the\r\nGNU General Public License for more details.\r\n\r\nYou should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License\r\nalong with this program; if not, write to the Free Software\r\nFoundation, Inc., 59 Temple Place - Suite 330, Boston, MA  02111-1307, USA.\r\nAlso add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.\r\n\r\nIf the program is interactive, make it output a short notice like this when it starts in an interactive mode:\r\n\r\nGnomovision version 69, Copyright (C) yyyy name of author\r\nGnomovision comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details\r\ntype `show w'.  This is free software, and you are welcome\r\nto redistribute it under certain conditions; type `show c'\r\nfor details.\r\nThe hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the appropriate parts of the General Public License. Of course, the commands you use may be called something other than `show w' and `show c'; they could even be mouse-clicks or menu items--whatever suits your program.\r\n\r\nYou should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your school, if any, to sign a \"copyright disclaimer\" for the program, if necessary. Here is a sample; alter the names:\r\n\r\nYoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright\r\ninterest in the program `Gnomovision'\r\n(which makes passes at compilers) written\r\nby James Hacker.\r\n\r\nsignature of Ty Coon, 1 April 1989\r\nTy Coon, President of Vice\r\nThis General Public License does not permit incorporating your program into proprietary programs. If your program is a subroutine library, you may consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with the library. If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Library General Public License instead of this License.\r\n\r\nMOZILLA PUBLIC LICENSE\r\nVersion 1.0\r\n\r\n1.

For purposes of this definition, \"control\" means (a) the power, direct or indirect, to cause the direction or management of such entity, whether by contract or otherwise, or (b) ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the outstanding shares or beneficial ownership of such entity.\r\n\r\n2. Source Code License.\r\n2.1. The Initial Developer Grant.\r\n\r\nThe Initial Developer hereby grants You a world-wide, royalty-free, non-exclusive license, subject to third party intellectual property claims:\r\n\r\n(a) to use, reproduce, modify, display, perform, sublicense and distribute the Original Code (or portions thereof) with or without Modifications, or as part of a Larger Work; and\r\n\r\n(b) under patents now or hereafter owned or controlled by Initial\r\n\r\nDeveloper, to make, have made, use and sell (\"Utilize\") the Original Code (or portions thereof), but solely to the extent that any such patent is reasonably necessary to enable You to Utilize the Original Code (or portions thereof) and not to any greater extent that may be necessary to Utilize further Modifications or combinations.\r\n\r\n2.2. Contributor Grant.\r\n\r\nEach Contributor hereby grants You a world-wide, royalty-free, non-exclusive license, subject to third party intellectual property claims:\r\n\r\n(a) to use, reproduce, modify, display, perform, sublicense and distribute the Modifications created by such Contributor (or portions thereof) either on an unmodified basis, with other Modifications, as Covered Code or as part of a Larger Work; and\r\n\r\n(b) under patents now or hereafter owned or controlled by Contributor, to Utilize the Contributor Version (or portions thereof), but solely to the extent that any such patent is reasonably necessary to enable You to Utilize the Contributor Version (or portions thereof), and not to any greater extent that may be necessary to Utilize further Modifications or combinations.\r\n\r\n3. Distribution Obligations.\r\n3.1. Application of License.\r\n\r\nThe Modifications which You create or to which You contribute are governed by the terms of this License, including without limitation Section 2.2. The Source Code version of Covered Code may be distributed only under the terms of this License or a future version of this License released under Section 6.1, and You must include a copy of this License with every copy of the Source Code You distribute. You may not offer or impose any terms on any Source Code version that alters or restricts the applicable version of this License or the recipients' rights hereunder. However, You may include an additional document offering the additional rights described in Section 3.5.\r\n\r\n3.2. Availability of Source Code.\r\n\r\nAny Modification which You create or to which You contribute must be made available in Source Code form under the terms of this License either on the same media as an Executable version or via an accepted Electronic Distribution Mechanism to anyone to whom you made an Executable version available; and if made available via Electronic Distribution Mechanism, must remain available for at least twelve (12) months after the date it initially became available, or at least six (6) months after a subsequent version of that particular Modification has been made available to such recipients. You are responsible for ensuring that the Source Code version remains available even if the Electronic Distribution Mechanism is maintained by a third party.\r\n\r\n3.3. Description of Modifications.\r\n\r\nYou must cause all Covered Code to which you contribute to contain a file documenting the changes You made to create that Covered Code and the date of any change. You must include a prominent statement that the Modification is derived, directly or indirectly, from Original Code provided by the Initial Developer and including the name of the Initial Developer in (a) the Source Code, and (b) in any notice in an Executable version or related documentation in which You describe the origin or ownership of the Covered Code.\r\n\r\n3.4. Intellectual Property Matters\r\n\r\n(a) Third Party Claims.\r\n\r\nIf You have knowledge that a party claims an intellectual property right in particular functionality or code (or its utilization under this License), you must include a text file with the source code distribution titled \"LEGAL\" which describes the claim and the party making the claim in sufficient detail that a recipient will know whom to contact. If you obtain such knowledge after You make Your Modification available as described in Section 3.2, You shall promptly modify the LEGAL file in all copies You make available thereafter and shall take other steps (such as notifying appropriate mailing lists or newsgroups) reasonably calculated to inform those who received the Covered Code that new knowledge has been obtained.\r\n\r\n(b) Contributor APIs.\r\n\r\nIf Your Modification is an application programming interface and You own or control patents which are reasonably necessary to implement that API, you must also include this information in the LEGAL file.\r\n\r\n3.5. Required Notices.\r\n\r\nYou must duplicate the notice in Exhibit A in each file of the Source Code, and this License in any documentation for the Source Code, where You describe recipients' rights relating to Covered Code. If You created one or more Modification(s), You may add your name as a Contributor to the notice described in Exhibit A. If it is not possible to put such notice in a particular Source Code file due to its structure, then you must include such notice in a location (such as a relevant directory file) where a user would be likely to look for such a notice. You may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligations to one or more recipients of Covered Code. However, You may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on behalf of the Initial Developer or any Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear than any such warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligation is offered by You alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify the Initial Developer and every Contributor for any liability incurred by the Initial Developer or such Contributor as a result of warranty, support, indemnity or liability terms You offer.\r\n\r\n3.6. Distribution of Executable Versions.\r\n\r\nYou may distribute Covered Code in Executable form only if the requirements of Section 3.1-3.5 have been met for that Covered Code, and if You include a notice stating that the Source Code version of the Covered Code is available under the terms of this License, including a description of how and where You have fulfilled the obligations of Section 3.2. The notice must be conspicuously included in any notice in an Executable version, related documentation or collateral in which You describe recipients' rights relating to the Covered Code. You may distribute the Executable version of Covered Code under a license of Your choice, which may contain terms different from this License, provided that You are in compliance with the terms of this License and that the license for the Executable version does not attempt to limit or alter the recipient's rights in the Source Code version from the rights set forth in this License. If You distribute the Executable version under a different license You must make it absolutely clear that any terms which differ from this License are offered by You alone, not by the Initial Developer or any Contributor. You hereby agree to indemnify the Initial Developer and every Contributor for any liability incurred by the Initial Developer or such Contributor as a result of any such terms You offer.\r\n\r\n3.7. Larger Works.\r\n\r\nYou may create a Larger Work by combining Covered Code with other code not governed by the terms of this License and distribute the Larger Work as a single product. In such a case, You must make sure the requirements of this License are fulfilled for the Covered Code.\r\n\r\n4. Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation.\r\nIf it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this License with respect to some or all of the Covered Code due to statute or regulation then You must: (a) comply with the terms of this License to the maximum extent possible; and (b) describe the limitations and the code they affect. Such description must be included in the LEGAL file described in Section 3.4 and must be included with all distributions of the Source Code. Except to the extent prohibited by statute or regulation, such description must be sufficiently detailed for a recipient of ordinary skill to be able to understand it.\r\n\r\n5. Application of this License.\r\nThis License applies to code to which the Initial Developer has attached the notice in Exhibit A, and to related Covered Code.\r\n\r\n6. Versions of the License.\r\n6.1. New Versions.\r\n\r\nNetscape Communications Corporation (\"Netscape\") may publish revised and/or new versions of the License from time to time. Each version will be given a distinguishing version number.\r\n\r\n6.2. Effect of New Versions.\r\n\r\nOnce Covered Code has been published under a particular version of the License, You may always continue to use it under the terms of that version. You may also choose to use such Covered Code under the terms of any subsequent version of the License published by Netscape. No one other than Netscape has the right to modify the terms applicable to Covered Code created under this License.\r\n\r\n6.3. Derivative Works.\r\n\r\nIf you create or use a modified version of this License (which you may only do in order to apply it to code which is not already Covered Code governed by this License), you must (a) rename Your license so that the phrases \"Mozilla\", \"MOZILLAPL\", \"MOZPL\", \"Netscape\", \"NPL\" or any confusingly similar phrase do not appear anywhere in your license and (b) otherwise make it clear that your version of the license contains terms which differ from the Mozilla Public License and Netscape Public License. (Filling in the name of the Initial Developer, Original Code or Contributor in the notice described in Exhibit A shall not of themselves be deemed to be modifications of this License.)\r\n\r\n7. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY.\r\nCOVERED CODE IS PROVIDED UNDER THIS LICENSE ON AN \"AS IS\" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES THAT THE COVERED CODE IS FREE OF DEFECTS, MERCHANTABLE, FIT FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR NON-INFRINGING. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE COVERED CODE IS WITH YOU. SHOULD ANY COVERED CODE PROVE DEFECTIVE IN ANY RESPECT, YOU (NOT THE INITIAL DEVELOPER OR ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR) ASSUME THE COST OF ANY NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION. THIS DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY CONSTITUTES AN ESSENTIAL PART OF THIS LICENSE. NO USE OF ANY COVERED CODE IS AUTHORIZED HEREUNDER EXCEPT UNDER THIS DISCLAIMER.\r\n\r\n8. TERMINATION.\r\nThis License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate automatically if You fail to comply with terms herein and fail to cure such breach within 30 days of becoming aware of the breach. All sublicenses to the Covered Code which are properly granted shall survive any termination of this License. Provisions which, by their nature, must remain in effect beyond the termination of this License shall survive.\r\n\r\n9. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY.\r\nUNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES AND UNDER NO LEGAL THEORY, WHETHER TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), CONTRACT, OR OTHERWISE, SHALL THE INITIAL DEVELOPER, ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR, OR ANY DISTRIBUTOR OF COVERED CODE, OR ANY SUPPLIER OF ANY OF SUCH PARTIES, BE LIABLE TO YOU OR ANY OTHER PERSON FOR ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY CHARACTER INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF GOODWILL, WORK STOPPAGE, COMPUTER FAILURE OR MALFUNCTION, OR ANY AND ALL OTHER COMMERCIAL DAMAGES OR LOSSES, EVEN IF SUCH PARTY SHALL HAVE BEEN INFORMED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. THIS LIMITATION OF LIABILITY SHALL NOT APPLY TO LIABILITY FOR DEATH OR PERSONAL INJURY RESULTING FROM SUCH PARTY'S NEGLIGENCE TO THE EXTENT APPLICABLE LAW PROHIBITS SUCH LIMITATION. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO THAT EXCLUSION AND LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.\r\n\r\n10. U.S. GOVERNMENT END USERS.\r\nThe Covered Code is a \"commercial item,\" as that term is defined in 48 C.F.R. 2.101 (Oct. 1995), consisting of \"commercial computer software\" and \"commercial computer software documentation,\" as such terms are used in 48 C.F.R. 12.212 (Sept. 1995). Consistent with 48 C.F.R. 12.212 and 48 C.F.R. 227.7202-1 through 227.7202-4 (June 1995), all U.S. Government End Users acquire Covered Code with only those rights set forth herein.\r\n\r\n11. MISCELLANEOUS.\r\nThis License represents the complete agreement concerning subject matter hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be unenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only to the extent necessary to make it enforceable. This License shall be governed by California law provisions (except to the extent applicable law, if any, provides otherwise), excluding its conflict-of-law provisions. With respect to disputes in which at least one party is a citizen of, or an entity chartered or registered to do business in, the United States of America: (a) unless otherwise agreed in writing, all disputes relating to this License (excepting any dispute relating to intellectual property rights) shall be subject to final and binding arbitration, with the losing party paying all costs of arbitration; (b) any arbitration relating to this Agreement shall be held in Santa Clara County, California, under the auspices of JAMS/EndDispute; and (c) any litigation relating to this Agreement shall be subject to the jurisdiction of the Federal Courts of the Northern District of California, with venue lying in Santa Clara County, California, with the losing party responsible for costs, including without limitation, court costs and reasonable attorneys fees and expenses. The application of the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods is expressly excluded. Any law or regulation which provides that the language of a contract shall be construed against the drafter shall not apply to this License.\r\n\r\n12. RESPONSIBILITY FOR CLAIMS.\r\nExcept in cases where another Contributor has failed to comply with Section 3.4, You are responsible for damages arising, directly or indirectly, out of Your utilization of rights under this License, based on the number of copies of Covered Code you made available, the revenues you received from utilizing such rights, and other relevant factors. You agree to work with affected parties to distribute responsibility on an equitable basis.\r\n\r\nEXHIBIT A.\r\n``The contents of this file are subject to the Mozilla Public License Version 1.0 (the \"License\"); you may not use this file except in compliance with the License.

If it is not possible to put such notice in a particular Source Code file due to its structure, then You must include such notice in a location (such as a relevant directory) where a user would be likely to look for such a notice. If You created one or more Modification(s) You may add Your name as a Contributor to the notice described in Exhibit A. You must also duplicate this License in any documentation for the Source Code where You describe recipients' rights or ownership rights relating to Initial Code. You may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligations to one or more recipients of Your version of the Code. However, You may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on behalf of the Initial Developer. You must make it absolutely clear than any such warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligation is offered by You alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify the Initial Developer for any liability incurred by the Initial Developer as a result of warranty, support, indemnity or liability terms You offer.\r\n\r\n3.3 Distribution of Executable Versions. \r\nYou may distribute Original Code in Executable and Source form only if the requirements of Sections 3.1 and 3.2 have been met for that Original Code, and if You include a notice stating that the Source Code version of the Original Code is available under the terms of this License. The notice must be conspicuously included in any notice in an Executable or Source versions, related documentation or collateral in which You describe recipients' rights relating to the Original Code. You may distribute the Executable and Source versions of Your version of the Code or ownership rights under a license of Your choice, which may contain terms different from this License, provided that You are in compliance with the terms of this License. If You distribute the Executable and Source versions under a different license You must make it absolutely clear that any terms which differ from this License are offered by You alone, not by the Initial Developer. You hereby agree to indemnify the Initial Developer for any liability incurred by the Initial Developer as a result of any such terms You offer.\r\n\r\n3.4 Larger Works. \r\nYou may create a Larger Work by combining Original Code with other code not governed by the terms of this License and distribute the Larger Work as a single product. In such a case, You must make sure the requirements of this License are fulfilled for the Original Code.\r\n\r\n4.0 INABILITY TO COMPLY DUE TO STATUTE OR REGULATION\r\n\r\nIf it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this License with respect to some or all of the Original Code due to statute, judicial order, or regulation then You must: (a) comply with the terms of this License to the maximum extent possible; and (b) describe the limitations and the code they affect. Such description must be included in the LEGAL file described in Section 3.2 and must be included with all distributions of the Source Code. Except to the extent prohibited by statute or regulation, such description must be sufficiently detailed for a recipient of ordinary skill to be able to understand it.\r\n\r\n5.0 APPLICATION OF THIS LICENSE\r\n\r\nThis License applies to code to which the Initial Developer has attached the notice in Exhibit A and to related Modifications as set out in Section 3.1.\r\n\r\n6.0 VERSIONS OF THE LICENSE\r\n\r\n6.1 New Versions. \r\nSun may publish revised and/or new versions of the License from time to time. Each version will be given a distinguishing version number.\r\n\r\n6.2 Effect of New Versions. \r\nOnce Original Code has been published under a particular version of the License, You may always continue to use it under the terms of that version. You may also choose to use such Original Code under the terms of any subsequent version of the License published by Sun. No one other than Sun has the right to modify the terms applicable to Original Code.\r\n\r\n7.0 DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY\r\n\r\nORIGINAL CODE IS PROVIDED UNDER THIS LICENSE ON AN \"AS IS\" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES THAT THE ORIGINAL CODE IS FREE OF DEFECTS, MERCHANTABLE, FIT FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR NON-INFRINGING. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE ORIGINAL CODE IS WITH YOU. SHOULD ANY ORIGINAL CODE PROVE DEFECTIVE IN ANY RESPECT, YOU (NOT THE INITIAL DEVELOPER) ASSUME THE COST OF ANY NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION. THIS DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY CONSTITUTES AN ESSENTIAL PART OF THIS LICENSE. NO USE OF ANY ORIGINAL CODE IS AUTHORIZED HEREUNDER EXCEPT UNDER THIS DISCLAIMER.\r\n\r\n8.0 TERMINATION\r\n\r\n8.1 This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate automatically if You fail to comply with terms herein and fail to cure such breach within 30 days of becoming aware of the breach. All sublicenses to the Original Code which are properly granted shall survive any termination of this License. Provisions which, by their nature, must remain in effect beyond the termination of this License shall survive.\r\n\r\n8.2 In the event of termination under Section 8.1 above, all end user license agreements (excluding distributors and resellers) which have been validly granted by You or any distributor hereunder prior to termination shall survive termination.\r\n\r\n9.0 LIMIT OF LIABILITY\r\n\r\nUNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES AND UNDER NO LEGAL THEORY, WHETHER TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), CONTRACT, OR OTHERWISE, SHALL YOU, THE INITIAL DEVELOPER, ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR, OR ANY DISTRIBUTOR OF ORIGINAL CODE, OR ANY SUPPLIER OF ANY OF SUCH PARTIES, BE LIABLE TO ANY PERSON FOR ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY CHARACTER INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF GOODWILL, WORK STOPPAGE, COMPUTER FAILURE OR MALFUNCTION, OR ANY AND ALL OTHER COMMERCIAL DAMAGES OR LOSSES, EVEN IF SUCH PARTY SHALL HAVE BEEN INFORMED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. THIS LIMITATION OF LIABILITY SHALL NOT APPLY TO LIABILITY FOR DEATH OR PERSONAL INJURY RESULTING FROM SUCH PARTY'S NEGLIGENCE TO THE EXTENT APPLICABLE LAW PROHIBITS SUCH LIMITATION. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO THIS EXCLUSION AND LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.\r\n\r\n10.0 U.S. GOVERNMENT END USERS\r\n\r\nU.S. Government: If this Software is being acquired by or on behalf of the U.S. Government or by a U.S. Government prime contractor or subcontractor (at any tier), then the Government's rights in the Software and accompanying documentation shall be only as set forth in this license; this is in accordance with 48 C.F.R. 227.7201 through 227.7202-4 (for Department of Defense (DoD) acquisitions) and with 48 C.F.R. 2.101 and 12.212 (for non-DoD acquisitions).\r\n\r\n11.0 MISCELLANEOUS\r\n\r\nThis License represents the complete agreement concerning subject matter hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be unenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only to the extent necessary to make it enforceable.

With respect to disputes in which at least one party is a citizen of, or an entity chartered or registered to do business in the United States of America, any litigation relating to this License shall be subject to the jurisdiction of the Federal Courts of the Northern District of California, with venue lying in Santa Clara County, California, with the losing party responsible for costs, including without limitation, court costs and reasonable attorneys' fees and expenses. The application of the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods is expressly excluded.

The Source Code version of Covered Code may be distributed only under the terms of this License or a future version of this License released under Section 6.1, and You must include a copy of this License with every copy of the Source Code You distribute. You may not offer or impose any terms on any Source Code version that alters or restricts the applicable version of this License or the recipients’ rights hereunder. However, You may include an additional document offering the additional rights described in Section 3.5.\r\n3.2\tAvailability of Source Code. \r\nAny Modification which You create or to which You contribute must be made available in Source Code form under the terms of this License either on the same media as an Executable version or via an accepted Electronic Distribution Mechanism to anyone to whom you made an Executable version available; and if made available via Electronic Distribution Mechanism, must remain available for at least twelve (12) months after the date it initially became available, or at least six (6) months after a subsequent version of that particular Modification has been made available to such recipients. You are responsible for ensuring that the Source Code version remains available even if the Electronic Distribution Mechanism is maintained by a third party.\r\n3.3\tDescription of Modifications. \r\nYou must cause all Covered Code to which You contribute to contain a file documenting the changes You made to create that Covered Code and the date of any change. You must include a prominent statement that the Modification is derived, directly or indirectly, from Original Code provided by the Initial Developer and including the name of the Initial Developer in (a) the Source Code, and (b) in any notice in an Executable version or related documentation in which You describe the origin or ownership of the Covered Code.\r\n3.4\tIntellectual Property Matters \r\n(a)\tThird Party Claims. \r\nIf Contributor has knowledge that a license under a third party’s intellectual property rights is required to exercise the rights granted by such Contributor under Sections 2.1 or 2.2, Contributor must include a text file with the Source Code distribution titled “LEGAL” which describes the claim and the party making the claim in sufficient detail that a recipient will know whom to contact. If Contributor obtains such knowledge after the Modification is made available as described in Section 3.2, Contributor shall promptly modify the LEGAL file in all copies Contributor makes available thereafter and shall take other steps (such as notifying appropriate mailing lists or newsgroups) reasonably calculated to inform those who received the Covered Code that new knowledge has been obtained.\r\n(b)\tContributor APIs. \r\nIf Contributor’s Modifications include an application programming interface and Contributor has knowledge of patent licenses which are reasonably necessary to implement that API, Contributor must also include this information in the LEGAL file.\r\n(c)\tRepresentations. \r\nContributor represents that, except as disclosed pursuant to Section 3.4(a) above, Contributor believes that Contributor’s Modifications are Contributor’s original creation(s) and/or Contributor has sufficient rights to grant the rights conveyed by this License.\r\n3.5\tRequired Notices. \r\nYou must duplicate the notice in Exhibit A in each file of the Source Code. If it is not possible to put such notice in a particular Source Code file due to its structure, then You must include such notice in a location (such as a relevant directory) where a user would be likely to look for such a notice. If You created one or more Modification(s) You may add your name as a Contributor to the notice described in Exhibit A. You must also duplicate this License in any documentation for the Source Code where You describe recipients’ rights or ownership rights relating to Covered Code. You may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligations to one or more recipients of Covered Code. However, You may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on behalf of the Initial Developer or any Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear than any such warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligation is offered by You alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify the Initial Developer and every Contributor for any liability incurred by the Initial Developer or such Contributor as a result of warranty, support, indemnity or liability terms You offer.\r\n3.6\tDistribution of Executable Versions. \r\nYou may distribute Covered Code in Executable form only if the requirements of Section 3.1-3.5 have been met for that Covered Code, and if You include a notice stating that the Source Code version of the Covered Code is available under the terms of this License, including a description of how and where You have fulfilled the obligations of Section 3.2. The notice must be conspicuously included in any notice in an Executable version, related documentation or collateral in which You describe recipients’ rights relating to the Covered Code. You may distribute the Executable version of Covered Code or ownership rights under a license of Your choice, which may contain terms different from this License, provided that You are in compliance with the terms of this License and that the license for the Executable version does not attempt to limit or alter the recipient’s rights in the Source Code version from the rights set forth in this License. If You distribute the Executable version under a different license You must make it absolutely clear that any terms which differ from this License are offered by You alone, not by the Initial Developer, Original Developer or any Contributor. You hereby agree to indemnify the Initial Developer, Original Developer and every Contributor for any liability incurred by the Initial Developer, Original Developer or such Contributor as a result of any such terms You offer.\r\n3.7\tLarger Works. \r\nYou may create a Larger Work by combining Covered Code with other code not governed by the terms of this License and distribute the Larger Work as a single product. In such a case, You must make sure the requirements of this License are fulfilled for the Covered Code.\r\n4.\tInability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation.\r\n\r\nIf it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this License with respect to some or all of the Covered Code due to statute, judicial order, or regulation then You must: (a) comply with the terms of this License to the maximum extent possible; and (b) describe the limitations and the code they affect. Such description must be included in the LEGAL file described in Section 3.4 and must be included with all distributions of the Source Code. Except to the extent prohibited by statute or regulation, such description must be sufficiently detailed for a recipient of ordinary skill to be able to understand it.\r\n5.\tApplication of this License.\r\n\r\nThis License applies to code to which the Initial Developer has attached the notice in Exhibit A and to related Covered Code.\r\n6.\tVersions of the License.\r\n\r\n6.1\tNew Versions.\r\nSocialtext, Inc. (“Socialtext”) may publish revised and/or new versions of the License from time to time. Each version will be given a distinguishing version number.\r\n6.2\tEffect of New Versions.\r\nOnce Covered Code has been published under a particular version of the License, You may always continue to use it under the terms of that version. You may also choose to use such Covered Code under the terms of any subsequent version of the License published by Socialtext. No one other than Socialtext has the right to modify the terms applicable to Covered Code created under this License.\r\n6.3\tDerivative Works.\r\nIf You create or use a modified version of this License (which you may only do in order to apply it to code which is not already Covered Code governed by this License), You must (a) rename Your license so that the phrases “Socialtext”, “CPAL” or any confusingly similar phrase do not appear in your license (except to note that your license differs from this License) and (b) otherwise make it clear that Your version of the license contains terms which differ from the CPAL. (Filling in the name of the Initial Developer, Original Developer, Original Code or Contributor in the notice described in Exhibit A shall not of themselves be deemed to be modifications of this License.)\r\n7.\tDISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY.\r\n\r\nCOVERED CODE IS PROVIDED UNDER THIS LICENSE ON AN “AS IS” BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES THAT THE COVERED CODE IS FREE OF DEFECTS, MERCHANTABLE, FIT FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR NON-INFRINGING. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE COVERED CODE IS WITH YOU. SHOULD ANY COVERED CODE PROVE DEFECTIVE IN ANY RESPECT, YOU (NOT THE INITIAL DEVELOPER, ORIGINAL DEVELOPER OR ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR) ASSUME THE COST OF ANY NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION. THIS DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY CONSTITUTES AN ESSENTIAL PART OF THIS LICENSE. NO USE OF ANY COVERED CODE IS AUTHORIZED HEREUNDER EXCEPT UNDER THIS DISCLAIMER.\r\n8.\tTERMINATION.\r\n\r\n8.1\tThis License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate automatically if You fail to comply with terms herein and fail to cure such breach within 30 days of becoming aware of the breach. All sublicenses to the Covered Code which are properly granted shall survive any termination of this License. Provisions which, by their nature, must remain in effect beyond the termination of this License shall survive.\r\n8.2\tIf You initiate litigation by asserting a patent infringement claim (excluding declatory judgment actions) against Initial Developer, Original Developer or a Contributor (the Initial Developer, Original Developer or Contributor against whom You file such action is referred to as “Participant”) alleging that:\r\n(a) such Participant’s Contributor Version directly or indirectly infringes any patent, then any and all rights granted by such Participant to You under Sections 2.1 and/or 2.2 of this License shall, upon 60 days notice from Participant terminate prospectively, unless if within 60 days after receipt of notice You either: (i) agree in writing to pay Participant a mutually agreeable reasonable royalty for Your past and future use of Modifications made by such Participant, or (ii) withdraw Your litigation claim with respect to the Contributor Version against such Participant. If within 60 days of notice, a reasonable royalty and payment arrangement are not mutually agreed upon in writing by the parties or the litigation claim is not withdrawn, the rights granted by Participant to You under Sections 2.1 and/or 2.2 automatically terminate at the expiration of the 60 day notice period specified above.\r\n(b)\tany software, hardware, or device, other than such Participant’s Contributor Version, directly or indirectly infringes any patent, then any rights granted to You by such Participant under Sections 2.1(b) and 2.2(b) are revoked effective as of the date You first made, used, sold, distributed, or had made, Modifications made by that Participant.\r\n8.3\tIf You assert a patent infringement claim against Participant alleging that such Participant’s Contributor Version directly or indirectly infringes any patent where such claim is resolved (such as by license or settlement) prior to the initiation of patent infringement litigation, then the reasonable value of the licenses granted by such Participant under Sections 2.1 or 2.2 shall be taken into account in determining the amount or value of any payment or license.\r\n8.4\tIn the event of termination under Sections 8.1 or 8.2 above, all end user license agreements (excluding distributors and resellers) which have been validly granted by You or any distributor hereunder prior to termination shall survive termination.\r\n9.\tLIMITATION OF LIABILITY.\r\n\r\nUNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES AND UNDER NO LEGAL THEORY, WHETHER TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), CONTRACT, OR OTHERWISE, SHALL YOU, THE INITIAL DEVELOPER, ORIGINAL DEVELOPER, ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR, OR ANY DISTRIBUTOR OF COVERED CODE, OR ANY SUPPLIER OF ANY OF SUCH PARTIES, BE LIABLE TO ANY PERSON FOR ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY CHARACTER INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF GOODWILL, WORK STOPPAGE, COMPUTER FAILURE OR MALFUNCTION, OR ANY AND ALL OTHER COMMERCIAL DAMAGES OR LOSSES, EVEN IF SUCH PARTY SHALL HAVE BEEN INFORMED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. THIS LIMITATION OF LIABILITY SHALL NOT APPLY TO LIABILITY FOR DEATH OR PERSONAL INJURY RESULTING FROM SUCH PARTY’S NEGLIGENCE TO THE EXTENT APPLICABLE LAW PROHIBITS SUCH LIMITATION. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO THIS EXCLUSION AND LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.\r\n10.\tU.S. GOVERNMENT END USERS.\r\n\r\nThe Covered Code is a “commercial item,” as that term is defined in 48 C.F.R. 2.101 (Oct. 1995), consisting of “commercial computer software” and “commercial computer software documentation,” as such terms are used in 48 C.F.R. 12.212 (Sept. 1995). Consistent with 48 C.F.R. 12.212 and 48 C.F.R. 227.7202-1 through 227.7202-4 (June 1995), all U.S. Government End Users acquire Covered Code with only those rights set forth herein.\r\n11.\tMISCELLANEOUS.\r\n\r\nThis License represents the complete agreement concerning subject matter hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be unenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only to the extent necessary to make it enforceable. This License shall be governed by California law provisions (except to the extent applicable law, if any, provides otherwise), excluding its conflict-of-law provisions. With respect to disputes in which at least one party is a citizen of, or an entity chartered or registered to do business in the United States of America, any litigation relating to this License shall be subject to the jurisdiction of the Federal Courts of the Northern District of California, with venue lying in Santa Clara County, California, with the losing party responsible for costs, including without limitation, court costs and reasonable attorneys’ fees and expenses. The application of the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods is expressly excluded. Any law or regulation which provides that the language of a contract shall be construed against the drafter shall not apply to this License.\r\n12.\tRESPONSIBILITY FOR CLAIMS.\r\n\r\nAs between Initial Developer, Original Developer and the Contributors, each party is responsible for claims and damages arising, directly or indirectly, out of its utilization of rights under this License and You agree to work with Initial Developer, Original Developer and Contributors to distribute such responsibility on an equitable basis. Nothing herein is intended or shall be deemed to constitute any admission of liability.\r\n13.\tMULTIPLE-LICENSED CODE.\r\n\r\nInitial Developer may designate portions of the Covered Code as Multiple-Licensed. Multiple-Licensed means that the Initial Developer permits you to utilize portions of the Covered Code under Your choice of the CPAL or the alternative licenses, if any, specified by the Initial Developer in the file described in Exhibit A.\r\n14.\tADDITIONAL TERM: ATTRIBUTION\r\n\r\n(a)\tAs a modest attribution to the organizer of the development of the Original Code (“Original Developer”), in the hope that its promotional value may help justify the time, money and effort invested in writing the Original Code, the Original Developer may include in Exhibit B (“Attribution Information”) a requirement that each time an Executable and Source Code or a Larger Work is launched or initially run (which includes initiating a session), a prominent display of the Original Developer’s Attribution Information (as defined below) must occur on the graphic user interface employed by the end user to access such Covered Code (which may include display on a splash screen), if any. The size of the graphic image should be consistent with the size of the other elements of the Attribution Information. If the access by the end user to the Executable and Source Code does not create a graphic user interface for access to the Covered Code, this obligation shall not apply. If the Original Code displays such Attribution Information in a particular form (such as in the form of a splash screen, notice at login, an “about” display, or dedicated attribution area on user interface screens), continued use of such form for that Attribution Information is one way of meeting this requirement for notice.\r\n(b)\tAttribution information may only include a copyright notice, a brief phrase, graphic image and a URL (“Attribution Information”) and is subject to the Attribution Limits as defined below. For these purposes, prominent shall mean display for sufficient duration to give reasonable notice to the user of the identity of the Original Developer and that if You include Attribution Information or similar information for other parties, You must ensure that the Attribution Information for the Original Developer shall be no less prominent than such Attribution Information or similar information for the other party. For greater certainty, the Original Developer may choose to specify in Exhibit B below that the above attribution requirement only applies to an Executable and Source Code resulting from the Original Code or any Modification, but not a Larger Work.

È vietata l'utilizzazione dell'opera in forme diverse da quelle autorizzate dalla presente licenza (nella misura in cui tale utilizzazione sia riservata in via esclusiva al titolare dei diritti d'autore sull'opera). \r\n\r\nL'opera originaria è fornita alle condizioni della presente licenza quando il licenziante (come definito in prosieguo) ha posto la seguente dicitura immediatamente dopo l'indicazione del copyright sull'opera originale:\r\n\r\nConcesso in licenza a norma dell'EUPL v.1.1\r\n\r\novvero abbia espresso con qualunque altro mezzo la propria volontà di cederlo in licenza alle condizioni dell'EUPL.\r\n\r\n1. Definizioni\r\n\r\nNella presente Licenza i seguenti termini sono così definiti:\r\n\r\n- Licenza: la presente Licenza. \r\n\r\n- Opera originaria o Programma per elaboratore: il programma per elaboratore \r\ndistribuito o comunicato dal licenziante alle condizioni della presente licenza, sotto forma di codice sorgente e, a seconda dei casi, anche sotto forma di Codice eseguibile. \r\n\r\n- Opere derivate: le opere o il programma per elaboratore che possono essere creati dal licenziatario sulla base dell'opera originaria o di una sua modificazione. La presente licenza non definisce quale grado di modificazione o di dipendenza rispetto all'opera originaria sia prescritto per caratterizzare un'opera come Opera derivata; tale questione è disciplinata dalla legge sul diritto d'autore applicato nel paese designato all'articolo 15.\r\n\r\n- Opera: l'opera originaria e le opere da essa derivate. \r\n\r\n- Codice sorgente: forma leggibile dell'opera che risulta più appropriata per essere studiata e modificata dall'uomo. \r\n \r\n- Codice eseguibile: il codice che, in genere, è stato compilato e che è destinato a essere eseguito come programma da un elaboratore. \r\n\r\n- Licenziante: la persona fisica o giuridica o l'ente che distribuisce o comunica l'opera secondo i termini della licenza. \r\n\r\n- Contributore (contributori): la persona fisica o giuridica o l'ente che modifica\r\nl'opera secondo i termini della licenza o altrimenti contribuisce alla creazione di \r\nun'opera derivata. \r\n\r\n- Licenziatario: la persona fisica o giuridica o l'ente che fa uso del programma per elaboratore secondo i termini della licenza. \r\n\r\n- Distribuzione e/o Comunicazione: la vendita, la cessione a titolo gratuito, il prestito, la locazione, la distribuzione, la comunicazione, la trasmissione o qualsiasi altro atto finalizzato a mettere copie dell'opera a disposizione di altre persone fisiche o giuridiche, o fornire loro accesso alle sue funzionalità essenziali, on-line o off-line. \r\n\r\n2. Estensione dei diritti concessi dalla licenza\r\n\r\nIl Licenziante concede al Licenziatario, per tutta la durata del diritto d'autore \r\nsull'opera originaria, una licenza mondiale, gratuita, non esclusiva, a sua volta \r\ncedibile in sub-licenza, che conferisce il diritto di compiere gli atti seguenti:\r\n\r\n- utilizzare l'Opera in qualsiasi circostanza e per ogni utilizzo,\r\n- riprodurre l'Opera,\r\n- modificare l'Opera originaria e creare Opere derivate basate su di essa,\r\n- comunicare al pubblico, anche mediante messa a disposizione o esposizione \r\ndell'Opera o di copie di essa e, a seconda dei casi, rappresentare l'Opera in \r\nforma pubblica,\r\n- distribuire l'Opera o copie di essa,\r\n- cedere in prestito e in locazione l'Opera o copie di essa,\r\n- concedere in sub-licenza i diritti sull'opera o copie di essa.\r\n\r\nI diritti suddetti possono essere esercitati con qualsiasi mezzo di comunicazione, su qualsiasi supporto e in qualsiasi formato, attualmente noto o che sarà successivamente inventato, nella misura consentita dal diritto applicabile.\r\nNei paesi in cui si applicano i diritti morali di autore, il Licenziante rinuncia al diritto di esercitare i suoi diritti morali nella misura consentita dalla legge affinché la cessione in licenza dei diritti patrimoniali sopra indicati possa produrre tutti i suoi effetti.\r\nIl Licenziante concede al Licenziatario, a titolo gratuito e non esclusivo, il diritto di utilizzare qualsiasi brevetto detenuto dal Licenziante, nella misura necessaria \r\nall'esercizio dei diritti di utilizzazione dell'Opera concessi dalla presente licenza.\r\n\r\n3. Comunicazione del codice sorgente\r\n\r\nIl licenziante può fornire l'Opera o sotto forma di Codice sorgente o come Codice eseguibile. Se l'opera è fornita come Codice eseguibile, il Licenziante fornisce, in aggiunta, una copia leggibile dall'elaboratore del Codice sorgente dell'Opera a corredo di ogni copia dell'Opera da lui distribuita oppure indica, in un avviso che segue l'indicazione dei diritti d'autore apposta sull'Opera, un archivio in cui il Codice sorgente è facilmente e gratuitamente accessibile per tutto il periodo in cui il Licenziante distribuisce o comunica l'opera. \r\n\r\n4. Limitazioni del diritto d'autore\r\n\r\nNessuna clausola della presente Licenza è finalizzata a impedire al Licenziatario di beneficiare di tutte le eccezioni o limitazioni applicabili ai diritti esclusivi dei titolari dei diritti sul Programma per elaboratore o sull'Opera originaria, dell'esaurimento di tali diritti o di qualsiasi altra limitazione applicabile.\r\n\r\n5. Obblighi del licenziatario\r\n\r\nLa concessione dei diritti sopra indicati è soggetta ad alcune restrizioni e obblighi in capo al Licenziatario. Gli obblighi sono i seguenti: \r\n\r\nDiritto di attribuzione: il Licenziatario lascia intatti tutti gli avvisi relativi ai diritti \r\nd'autore, ai brevetti o ai marchi e tutte le indicazioni che fanno riferimento alla \r\nLicenza e all'esclusione della garanzia. Ogni copia dell'Opera che il Licenziatario distribuisce o comunica deve essere corredata di una copia di tali avvisi e di una copia della Licenza. Su tutte le Opere derivate il Licenziatario deve apporre o far apporre avvisi ben visibili indicanti che l'Opera è stata modificata e la data della modificazione.\r\n \r\nClausola 'copyleft': se il Licenziatario distribuisce o comunica copie delle Opere \r\noriginarie o delle Opere derivate basate sull'Opera originaria, la distribuzione o \r\ncomunicazione ha luogo nell'osservanza delle clausole della presente Licenza o di una sua versione successiva a meno che l'Opera originaria venga esplicitamente distribuita solo nel quadro della presente versione della Licenza. Il Licenziatario (che in tal caso diventa Licenziante) non può offrire né imporre termini o condizioni ulteriori sull'Opera o sulle Opere derivate che alterino o restringano le condizioni della Licenza.\r\n \r\nClausola di compatibilità: se il Licenziatario distribuisce o comunica le Opere \r\nderivate o copie delle Opere derivate basate sull'Opera originaria o su altra opera concessa in licenza secondo le condizioni di una Licenza compatibile, la \r\nDistribuzione o Comunicazione può avvenire nell'osservanza delle clausole della \r\nlicenza compatibile. Ai fini dell'applicazione della presente clausola, l'espressione \"Licenza compatibile\" si riferisce alle licenze enumerate nell'allegato della presente Licenza. In caso di conflitto tra gli obblighi del Licenziatario a norma della Licenza compatibile e i suoi obblighi a norma della presente Licenza, prevalgono gli obblighi prescritti dalla Licenza compatibile.\r\n\r\nFornitura del Codice sorgente: se distribuisce o comunica copie dell'Opera, il \r\nLicenziatario fornirà copia del Codice sorgente in formato leggibile dall'elaboratore oppure indicherà un archivio in cui tale Codice sorgente è facilmente e liberamente accessibile, per tutto il tempo in cui distribuisce o comunica l'Opera.\r\n \r\nTutela dei diritti: la presente Licenza non autorizza a fare uso di nomi commerciali, di marchi distintivi di prodotti o servizi o dei nomi dei licenzianti, se non nei limiti necessari ad una utilizzazione ragionevole e conforme agli usi per descrivere l'origine dell'Opera e riprodurre il contenuto dell'avviso relativo al diritto d'autore.\r\n \r\n6. Autori e contributori\r\n\r\nIl Licenziante originario garantisce che i diritti d'autore sull'Opera originaria concessi a norma della presente Licenza sono di sua proprietà ovvero gli sono concessi in licenza e che dispone del diritto e del potere di concedere la Licenza.\r\n\r\nCiascun Contributore garantisce che i diritti d'autore sulle modifiche che egli apporta all'opera sono di sua proprietà o che gli sono concessi in licenza e che dispone del diritto e del potere di concedere la Licenza.\r\n\r\nOgni volta che accettate la Licenza, il Licenziante originario e i Contributori \r\nsuccessivi vi concedono una licenza sui loro contributi all'Opera, secondo le \r\ncondizioni della presente Licenza.\r\n\r\n7. Esclusione della garanzia\r\n\r\nL'Opera è un'opera in divenire, che viene costantemente migliorata grazie all'apporto di diversi contributori. Non si tratta di un'opera finita e può pertanto contenere difetti o errori inerenti a questo tipo di sviluppo di programmi per elaboratori. \r\n\r\nPer tale ragione, l'Opera è concessa in Licenza \"così com'è\" e senza garanzie di alcun genere, ivi incluse, ma senza limitarsi a queste, quelle relative all'utilizzazione commerciale, all'idoneità a soddisfare una determinata funzione, all'assenza di difetti o errori, all'accuratezza, all'efficacia, alla non violazione di diritti di proprietà intellettuale diversi dal diritto d'autore come indicato all'articolo 6 della presente Licenza.\r\n\r\nLa presente esclusione di garanzia costituisce parte integrante della Licenza e \r\ncondizione per la concessione di qualsiasi diritto sull'Opera.\r\n\r\n8. Esclusione di responsabilità\r\n\r\nSalvi i casi di comportamenti dolosi o di danni direttamente arrecati a persone fisiche, in nessun caso il Licenziante può essere ritenuto responsabile per i danni, di qualsiasi natura, diretti o indiretti, materiali o morali, derivanti dalla Licenza o dall'utilizzazione dell'Opera, ivi compresi, ma senza limitarsi a questi, i danni per perdita di avviamento, interruzione del lavoro, guasto o malfunzionamento dell'elaboratore, perdita di dati e qualsiasi danno commerciale, anche nel caso in cui il Licenziante fosse stato informato che tali danni avrebbero potuto verificarsi. Tuttavia, il licenziante sarà tenuto responsabile a norma delle leggi sulla responsabilità da prodotto in quanto applicabili all'Opera. \r\n\r\n9. Altre pattuizioni\r\n\r\nAll'atto della distribuzione dell'Opera originaria o delle Opere derivate, avrete facoltà di stipulare pattuizioni aggiuntive al fine di offrire, a titolo oneroso, assistenza, garanzia, indennità o assumere altre responsabilità o fornire altri servizi compatibili con la presente Licenza. Tuttavia, nell'accettare tali obbligazioni, agirete esclusivamente in nome proprio e sotto propria esclusiva responsabilità, e non in nome del Licenziante originario o di qualsiasi altro Contributore, e solo subordinatamente all'assunzione di impegno risarcire, difendere e tenere indenne ciascun Contributore da eventuali responsabilità o richieste risarcitorie rivolte allo stesso Contributore in conseguenza delle garanzie o responsabilità aggiuntive da voi assunte.\r\n \r\n10. Accettazione della licenza\r\n\r\nLe clausole della presente Licenza possono essere accettate cliccando sull'icona \"Accetto\" posta sotto una finestra che fa apparire il testo della presente Licenza o prestando consenso in qualsiasi altro modo simile, conformemente alle disposizioni di legge applicabili. Cliccando su tale icona manifesterete la chiara e irrevocabile accettazione della presente Licenza e di tutti i suoi termini e condizioni.\r\n\r\nAnalogamente accetterete irrevocabilmente la presente Licenza e tutti i suoi termini e condizioni esercitando uno qualsiasi dei diritti a voi concessi dall'articolo 2 della presente Licenza, quali l'utilizzazione da parte vostra dell'Opera, la creazione di un'Opera derivata o la distribuzione o comunicazione dell'Opera o di copie di essa.\r\n\r\n11. Informazione del pubblico\r\n\r\nSe procederete a distribuzione o comunicazione dell'opera mediante strumenti di comunicazione elettronica (ad esempio, offrendo di scaricare l'Opera da un luogo remoto) il canale di distribuzione o i mezzi di comunicazione (ad esempio un sito web) dovranno fornire al pubblico come minimo le informazioni prescritte dalla normativa applicabile in relazione al Licenziante, alla Licenza e al modo con cui essa può essere resa accessibile, accettata, conservata e riprodotta da parte del Licenziatario.\r\n\r\n12. Cessazione della licenza\r\n\r\nLa licenza e i diritti da essa concessi cesseranno automaticamente di avere effetto ove il Licenziatario violi una qualsiasi delle condizioni previste dalla Licenza.\r\n\r\nTale cessazione non comporterà cessazione delle Licenze concesse a persone che abbiano ricevuto l'opera dal Licenziatario a norma della Licenza, sempreché tali persone ottemperino integralmente alle clausole della Licenza stessa.\r\n\r\n13. Varie\r\n\r\nFerme restando le disposizioni dell'articolo 9, la Licenza costituisce l'accordo \r\nintegrale tra le parti in merito all'Opera qui concessa in Licenza.\r\n\r\nLe clausole della Licenza che risultino nulle o non possano essere fatte valere in base alla normativa applicabile non incideranno sulla validità o sull'azionabilità della Licenza nel suo complesso. Le clausole in questione saranno interpretate o modificate nella misura necessaria a renderle valide e azionabili. \r\n\r\nLa Commissione europea può pubblicare altre versioni linguistiche e/o nuove versioni della presente Licenza, nella misura in cui ciò è necessario e ragionevole, senza ridurre la portata dei diritti accordati dalla presente Licenza. Le nuove versioni della Licenza saranno pubblicate con un numero di versione unico. \r\n\r\nTutte le versioni linguistiche della presente Licenza approvate dalla Commissione europea hanno lo stesso valore. Le parti possono utilizzare la versione linguistica di loro scelta.\r\n \r\n14. Foro competente\r\n\r\nPer qualsiasi controversia in ordine all'interpretazione della presente Licenza che insorga tra la Commissione europea nella qualità di Licenziante e il Licenziatario è competente la Corte di giustizia delle Comunità europee, a norma dell'articolo 238 del trattato che istituisce la Comunità europea.\r\n\r\nPer qualsiasi controversia che insorga tra parti diverse dalla Commissione europea, in ordine all'interpretazione della presente Licenza è esclusivamente competente il tribunale del luogo in cui il Licenziante risiede o esercita la sua attività principale.\r\n\r\n15. Legge applicabile\r\n\r\nLa presente Licenza è disciplinata dalla legge dello Stato membro dell'Unione \r\neuropea nel quale il Licenziante risiede o ha la propria sede sociale.\r\n\r\nLa presente Licenza è disciplinata dalla legge belga:\r\n\r\n- ove insorga controversia tra la Commissione europea nella qualità di \r\nLicenziante e un qualsiasi Licenziatario;\r\n- ove il Licenziante, diverso dalla Commissione europea, non risieda o non \r\nabbia la propria sede sociale in uno Stato membro dell'Unione europea.\r\n\r\n=== Appendice\r\n\r\n\"Licenze compatibili\" ai sensi dell'articolo 5 EUPL sono le seguenti:\r\n\r\n- GNU General Public License (GNU GPL) v. 2\r\n- Open Software License (OSL) v. 2.1, v. 3.0\r\n- Common Public License v. 1.0\r\n- Eclipse Public License v. 1.0\r\n- Cecill v. 2.0", notes: nil, similar_license_id: nil},
  {name: "afferogplv3", description: "GNU AFFERO GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE, Version 3 ", version: "3.0", category_id: 8, license_type_id: 4, flag_osi: true, text_license: "GNU AFFERO GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE, Version 3 (AGPL-3.0)\r\n\r\nCopyright (C) 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc. <http://fsf.org/>\r\nEveryone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.\r\n\r\nPreamble\r\nThe GNU Affero General Public License is a free, copyleft license for software and other kinds of works, specifically designed to ensure cooperation with the community in the case of network server software.\r\n\r\nThe licenses for most software and other practical works are designed to take away your freedom to share and change the works. By contrast, our General Public Licenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change all versions of a program--to make sure it remains free software for all its users.\r\n\r\nWhen we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price. Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for them if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new free programs, and that you know you can do these things.\r\n\r\nDevelopers that use our General Public Licenses protect your rights with two steps: (1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer you this License which gives you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the software.\r\n\r\nA secondary benefit of defending all users' freedom is that improvements made in alternate versions of the program, if they receive widespread use, become available for other developers to incorporate. Many developers of free software are heartened and encouraged by the resulting cooperation. However, in the case of software used on network servers, this result may fail to come about. The GNU General Public License permits making a modified version and letting the public access it on a server without ever releasing its source code to the public.\r\n\r\nThe GNU Affero General Public License is designed specifically to ensure that, in such cases, the modified source code becomes available to the community. It requires the operator of a network server to provide the source code of the modified version running there to the users of that server. Therefore, public use of a modified version, on a publicly accessible server, gives the public access to the source code of the modified version.\r\n\r\nAn older license, called the Affero General Public License and published by Affero, was designed to accomplish similar goals. This is a different license, not a version of the Affero GPL, but Affero has released a new version of the Affero GPL which permits relicensing under this license.\r\n\r\nThe precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modification follow.\r\n\r\nTERMS AND CONDITIONS\r\n0. Definitions.\r\n\"This License\" refers to version 3 of the GNU Affero General Public License.\r\n\r\n\"Copyright\" also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds of works, such as semiconductor masks.\r\n\r\n\"The Program\" refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this License. Each licensee is addressed as \"you\". \"Licensees\" and \"recipients\" may be individuals or organizations.\r\n\r\nTo \"modify\" a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work in a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of an exact copy. The resulting work is called a \"modified version\" of the earlier work or a work \"based on\" the earlier work.\r\n\r\nA \"covered work\" means either the unmodified Program or a work based on the Program.\r\n\r\nTo \"propagate\" a work means to do anything with it that, without permission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for infringement under applicable copyright law, except executing it on a computer or modifying a private copy. Propagation includes copying, distribution (with or without modification), making available to the public, and in some countries other activities as well.\r\n\r\nTo \"convey\" a work means any kind of propagation that enables other parties to make or receive copies. Mere interaction with a user through a computer network, with no transfer of a copy, is not conveying.\r\n\r\nAn interactive user interface displays \"Appropriate Legal Notices\" to the extent that it includes a convenient and prominently visible feature that (1) displays an appropriate copyright notice, and (2) tells the user that there is no warranty for the work (except to the extent that warranties are provided), that licensees may convey the work under this License, and how to view a copy of this License. If the interface presents a list of user commands or options, such as a menu, a prominent item in the list meets this criterion.\r\n\r\n1. Source Code.\r\nThe \"source code\" for a work means the preferred form of the work for making modifications to it. \"Object code\" means any non-source form of a work.\r\n\r\nA \"Standard Interface\" means an interface that either is an official standard defined by a recognized standards body, or, in the case of interfaces specified for a particular programming language, one that is widely used among developers working in that language.\r\n\r\nThe \"System Libraries\" of an executable work include anything, other than the work as a whole, that (a) is included in the normal form of packaging a Major Component, but which is not part of that Major Component, and (b) serves only to enable use of the work with that Major Component, or to implement a Standard Interface for which an implementation is available to the public in source code form. A \"Major Component\", in this context, means a major essential component (kernel, window system, and so on) of the specific operating system (if any) on which the executable work runs, or a compiler used to produce the work, or an object code interpreter used to run it.\r\n\r\nThe \"Corresponding Source\" for a work in object code form means all the source code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable work) run the object code and to modify the work, including scripts to control those activities. However, it does not include the work's System Libraries, or general-purpose tools or generally available free programs which are used unmodified in performing those activities but which are not part of the work. For example, Corresponding Source includes interface definition files associated with source files for the work, and the source code for shared libraries and dynamically linked subprograms that the work is specifically designed to require, such as by intimate data communication or control flow between those subprograms and other parts of the work.\r\n\r\nThe Corresponding Source need not include anything that users can regenerate automatically from other parts of the Corresponding Source.\r\n\r\nThe Corresponding Source for a work in source code form is that same work.\r\n\r\n2. Basic Permissions.\r\nAll rights granted under this License are granted for the term of copyright on the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated conditions are met. This License explicitly affirms your unlimited permission to run the unmodified Program. The output from running a covered work is covered by this License only if the output, given its content, constitutes a covered work. This License acknowledges your rights of fair use or other equivalent, as provided by copyright law.\r\n\r\nYou may make, run and propagate covered works that you do not convey, without conditions so long as your license otherwise remains in force. You may convey covered works to others for the sole purpose of having them make modifications exclusively for you, or provide you with facilities for running those works, provided that you comply with the terms of this License in conveying all material for which you do not control copyright. Those thus making or running the covered works for you must do so exclusively on your behalf, under your direction and control, on terms that prohibit them from making any copies of your copyrighted material outside their relationship with you.\r\n\r\nConveying under any other circumstances is permitted solely under the conditions stated below. Sublicensing is not allowed; section 10 makes it unnecessary.\r\n\r\n3. Protecting Users' Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law.\r\nNo covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological measure under any applicable law fulfilling obligations under article 11 of the WIPO copyright treaty adopted on 20 December 1996, or similar laws prohibiting or restricting circumvention of such measures.\r\n\r\nWhen you convey a covered work, you waive any legal power to forbid circumvention of technological measures to the extent such circumvention is effected by exercising rights under this License with respect to the covered work, and you disclaim any intention to limit operation or modification of the work as a means of enforcing, against the work's users, your or third parties' legal rights to forbid circumvention of technological measures.\r\n\r\n4. Conveying Verbatim Copies.\r\nYou may convey verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice; keep intact all notices stating that this License and any non-permissive terms added in accord with section 7 apply to the code; keep intact all notices of the absence of any warranty; and give all recipients a copy of this License along with the Program.\r\n\r\nYou may charge any price or no price for each copy that you convey, and you may offer support or warranty protection for a fee.\r\n\r\n5. Conveying Modified Source Versions.\r\nYou may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to produce it from the Program, in the form of source code under the terms of section 4, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:\r\n\r\na) The work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified it, and giving a relevant date.\r\nb) The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is released under this License and any conditions added under section 7. This requirement modifies the requirement in section 4 to \"keep intact all notices\".\r\nc) You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this License to anyone who comes into possession of a copy. This License will therefore apply, along with any applicable section 7 additional terms, to the whole of the work, and all its parts, regardless of how they are packaged. This License gives no permission to license the work in any other way, but it does not invalidate such permission if you have separately received it.\r\nd) If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must display Appropriate Legal Notices; however, if the Program has interactive interfaces that do not display Appropriate Legal Notices, your work need not make them do so.\r\nA compilation of a covered work with other separate and independent works, which are not by their nature extensions of the covered work, and which are not combined with it such as to form a larger program, in or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is called an \"aggregate\" if the compilation and its resulting copyright are not used to limit the access or legal rights of the compilation's users beyond what the individual works permit. Inclusion of a covered work in an aggregate does not cause this License to apply to the other parts of the aggregate.\r\n\r\n6. Conveying Non-Source Forms.\r\nYou may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms of sections 4 and 5, provided that you also convey the machine-readable Corresponding Source under the terms of this License, in one of these ways:\r\n\r\na) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by the Corresponding Source fixed on a durable physical medium customarily used for software interchange.\r\nb) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by a written offer, valid for at least three years and valid for as long as you offer spare parts or customer support for that product model, to give anyone who possesses the object code either (1) a copy of the Corresponding Source for all the software in the product that is covered by this License, on a durable physical medium customarily used for software interchange, for a price no more than your reasonable cost of physically performing this conveying of source, or (2) access to copy the Corresponding Source from a network server at no charge.\r\nc) Convey individual copies of the object code with a copy of the written offer to provide the Corresponding Source. This alternative is allowed only occasionally and noncommercially, and only if you received the object code with such an offer, in accord with subsection 6b.\r\nd) Convey the object code by offering access from a designated place (gratis or for a charge), and offer equivalent access to the Corresponding Source in the same way through the same place at no further charge. You need not require recipients to copy the Corresponding Source along with the object code. If the place to copy the object code is a network server, the Corresponding Source may be on a different server (operated by you or a third party) that supports equivalent copying facilities, provided you maintain clear directions next to the object code saying where to find the Corresponding Source. Regardless of what server hosts the Corresponding Source, you remain obligated to ensure that it is available for as long as needed to satisfy these requirements.\r\ne) Convey the object code using peer-to-peer transmission, provided you inform other peers where the object code and Corresponding Source of the work are being offered to the general public at no charge under subsection 6d.\r\nA separable portion of the object code, whose source code is excluded from the Corresponding Source as a System Library, need not be included in conveying the object code work.\r\n\r\nA \"User Product\" is either (1) a \"consumer product\", which means any tangible personal property which is normally used for personal, family, or household purposes, or (2) anything designed or sold for incorporation into a dwelling. In determining whether a product is a consumer product, doubtful cases shall be resolved in favor of coverage. For a particular product received by a particular user, \"normally used\" refers to a typical or common use of that class of product, regardless of the status of the particular user or of the way in which the particular user actually uses, or expects or is expected to use, the product. A product is a consumer product regardless of whether the product has substantial commercial, industrial or non-consumer uses, unless such uses represent the only significant mode of use of the product.\r\n\r\n\"Installation Information\" for a User Product means any methods, procedures, authorization keys, or other information required to install and execute modified versions of a covered work in that User Product from a modified version of its Corresponding Source. The information must suffice to ensure that the continued functioning of the modified object code is in no case prevented or interfered with solely because modification has been made.\r\n\r\nIf you convey an object code work under this section in, or with, or specifically for use in, a User Product, and the conveying occurs as part of a transaction in which the right of possession and use of the User Product is transferred to the recipient in perpetuity or for a fixed term (regardless of how the transaction is characterized), the Corresponding Source conveyed under this section must be accompanied by the Installation Information. But this requirement does not apply if neither you nor any third party retains the ability to install modified object code on the User Product (for example, the work has been installed in ROM).\r\n\r\nThe requirement to provide Installation Information does not include a requirement to continue to provide support service, warranty, or updates for a work that has been modified or installed by the recipient, or for the User Product in which it has been modified or installed. Access to a network may be denied when the modification itself materially and adversely affects the operation of the network or violates the rules and protocols for communication across the network.\r\n\r\nCorresponding Source conveyed, and Installation Information provided, in accord with this section must be in a format that is publicly documented (and with an implementation available to the public in source code form), and must require no special password or key for unpacking, reading or copying.\r\n\r\n7. Additional Terms.\r\n\"Additional permissions\" are terms that supplement the terms of this License by making exceptions from one or more of its conditions. Additional permissions that are applicable to the entire Program shall be treated as though they were included in this License, to the extent that they are valid under applicable law. If additional permissions apply only to part of the Program, that part may be used separately under those permissions, but the entire Program remains governed by this License without regard to the additional permissions.\r\n\r\nWhen you convey a copy of a covered work, you may at your option remove any additional permissions from that copy, or from any part of it. (Additional permissions may be written to require their own removal in certain cases when you modify the work.) You may place additional permissions on material, added by you to a covered work, for which you have or can give appropriate copyright permission.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding any other provision of this License, for material you add to a covered work, you may (if authorized by the copyright holders of that material) supplement the terms of this License with terms:\r\n\r\na) Disclaiming warranty or limiting liability differently from the terms of sections 15 and 16 of this License; or\r\nb) Requiring preservation of specified reasonable legal notices or author attributions in that material or in the Appropriate Legal Notices displayed by works containing it; or\r\nc) Prohibiting misrepresentation of the origin of that material, or requiring that modified versions of such material be marked in reasonable ways as different from the original version; or\r\nd) Limiting the use for publicity purposes of names of licensors or authors of the material; or\r\ne) Declining to grant rights under trademark law for use of some trade names, trademarks, or service marks; or\r\nf) Requiring indemnification of licensors and authors of that material by anyone who conveys the material (or modified versions of it) with contractual assumptions of liability to the recipient, for any liability that these contractual assumptions directly impose on those licensors and authors.\r\nAll other non-permissive additional terms are considered \"further restrictions\" within the meaning of section 10. If the Program as you received it, or any part of it, contains a notice stating that it is governed by this License along with a term that is a further restriction, you may remove that term. If a license document contains a further restriction but permits relicensing or conveying under this License, you may add to a covered work material governed by the terms of that license document, provided that the further restriction does not survive such relicensing or conveying.\r\n\r\nIf you add terms to a covered work in accord with this section, you must place, in the relevant source files, a statement of the additional terms that apply to those files, or a notice indicating where to find the applicable terms.\r\n\r\nAdditional terms, permissive or non-permissive, may be stated in the form of a separately written license, or stated as exceptions; the above requirements apply either way.\r\n\r\n8. Termination.\r\nYou may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise to propagate or modify it is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License (including any patent licenses granted under the third paragraph of section 11).\r\n\r\nHowever, if you cease all violation of this License, then your license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a) provisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and finally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright holder fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means prior to 60 days after the cessation.\r\n\r\nMoreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the violation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have received notice of violation of this License (for any work) from that copyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after your receipt of the notice.\r\n\r\nTermination of your rights under this section does not terminate the licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under this License. If your rights have been terminated and not permanently reinstated, you do not qualify to receive new licenses for the same material under section 10.\r\n\r\n9. Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies.\r\nYou are not required to accept this License in order to receive or run a copy of the Program. Ancillary propagation of a covered work occurring solely as a consequence of using peer-to-peer transmission to receive a copy likewise does not require acceptance. However, nothing other than this License grants you permission to propagate or modify any covered work. These actions infringe copyright if you do not accept this License. Therefore, by modifying or propagating a covered work, you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so.\r\n\r\n10. Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients.\r\nEach time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically receives a license from the original licensors, to run, modify and propagate that work, subject to this License. You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties with this License.\r\n\r\nAn \"entity transaction\" is a transaction transferring control of an organization, or substantially all assets of one, or subdividing an organization, or merging organizations. If propagation of a covered work results from an entity transaction, each party to that transaction who receives a copy of the work also receives whatever licenses to the work the party's predecessor in interest had or could give under the previous paragraph, plus a right to possession of the Corresponding Source of the work from the predecessor in interest, if the predecessor has it or can get it with reasonable efforts.\r\n\r\nYou may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the rights granted or affirmed under this License. For example, you may not impose a license fee, royalty, or other charge for exercise of rights granted under this License, and you may not initiate litigation (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that any patent claim is infringed by making, using, selling, offering for sale, or importing the Program or any portion of it.\r\n\r\n11. Patents.\r\nA \"contributor\" is a copyright holder who authorizes use under this License of the Program or a work on which the Program is based. The work thus licensed is called the contributor's \"contributor version\".\r\n\r\nA contributor's \"essential patent claims\" are all patent claims owned or controlled by the contributor, whether already acquired or hereafter acquired, that would be infringed by some manner, permitted by this License, of making, using, or selling its contributor version, but do not include claims that would be infringed only as a consequence of further modification of the contributor version. For purposes of this definition, \"control\" includes the right to grant patent sublicenses in a manner consistent with the requirements of this License.\r\n\r\nEach contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free patent license under the contributor's essential patent claims, to make, use, sell, offer for sale, import and otherwise run, modify and propagate the contents of its contributor version.\r\n\r\nIn the following three paragraphs, a \"patent license\" is any express agreement or commitment, however denominated, not to enforce a patent (such as an express permission to practice a patent or covenant not to sue for patent infringement). To \"grant\" such a patent license to a party means to make such an agreement or commitment not to enforce a patent against the party.\r\n\r\nIf you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on a patent license, and the Corresponding Source of the work is not available for anyone to copy, free of charge and under the terms of this License, through a publicly available network server or other readily accessible means, then you must either (1) cause the Corresponding Source to be so available, or (2) arrange to deprive yourself of the benefit of the patent license for this particular work, or (3) arrange, in a manner consistent with the requirements of this License, to extend the patent license to downstream recipients. \"Knowingly relying\" means you have actual knowledge that, but for the patent license, your conveying the covered work in a country, or your recipient's use of the covered work in a country, would infringe one or more identifiable patents in that country that you have reason to believe are valid.\r\n\r\nIf, pursuant to or in connection with a single transaction or arrangement, you convey, or propagate by procuring conveyance of, a covered work, and grant a patent license to some of the parties receiving the covered work authorizing them to use, propagate, modify or convey a specific copy of the covered work, then the patent license you grant is automatically extended to all recipients of the covered work and works based on it.\r\n\r\nA patent license is \"discriminatory\" if it does not include within the scope of its coverage, prohibits the exercise of, or is conditioned on the non-exercise of one or more of the rights that are specifically granted under this License. You may not convey a covered work if you are a party to an arrangement with a third party that is in the business of distributing software, under which you make payment to the third party based on the extent of your activity of conveying the work, and under which the third party grants, to any of the parties who would receive the covered work from you, a discriminatory patent license (a) in connection with copies of the covered work conveyed by you (or copies made from those copies), or (b) primarily for and in connection with specific products or compilations that contain the covered work, unless you entered into that arrangement, or that patent license was granted, prior to 28 March 2007.\r\n\r\nNothing in this License shall be construed as excluding or limiting any implied license or other defenses to infringement that may otherwise be available to you under applicable patent law.\r\n\r\n12. No Surrender of Others' Freedom.\r\nIf conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not excuse you from the conditions of this License. If you cannot convey a covered work so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may not convey it at all. For example, if you agree to terms that obligate you to collect a royalty for further conveying from those to whom you convey the Program, the only way you could satisfy both those terms and this License would be to refrain entirely from conveying the Program.\r\n\r\n13. Remote Network Interaction; Use with the GNU General Public License.\r\nNotwithstanding any other provision of this License, if you modify the Program, your modified version must prominently offer all users interacting with it remotely through a computer network (if your version supports such interaction) an opportunity to receive the Corresponding Source of your version by providing access to the Corresponding Source from a network server at no charge, through some standard or customary means of facilitating copying of software. This Corresponding Source shall include the Corresponding Source for any work covered by version 3 of the GNU General Public License that is incorporated pursuant to the following paragraph.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding any other provision of this License, you have permission to link or combine any covered work with a work licensed under version 3 of the GNU General Public License into a single combined work, and to convey the resulting work. The terms of this License will continue to apply to the part which is the covered work, but the work with which it is combined will remain governed by version 3 of the GNU General Public License.\r\n\r\n14. Revised Versions of this License.\r\nThe Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of the GNU Affero General Public License from time to time. Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.\r\n\r\nEach version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Program specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU Affero General Public License \"or any later version\" applies to it, you have the option of following the terms and conditions either of that numbered version or of any later version published by the Free Software Foundation. If the Program does not specify a version number of the GNU Affero General Public License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software Foundation.\r\n\r\nIf the Program specifies that a proxy can decide which future versions of the GNU Affero General Public License can be used, that proxy's public statement of acceptance of a version permanently authorizes you to choose that version for the Program.\r\n\r\nLater license versions may give you additional or different permissions. However, no additional obligations are imposed on any author or copyright holder as a result of your choosing to follow a later version.\r\n\r\n15. Disclaimer of Warranty.\r\nTHERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM \"AS IS\" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.\r\n\r\n16. Limitation of Liability.\r\nIN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MODIFIES AND/OR CONVEYS THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.\r\n\r\n17. Interpretation of Sections 15 and 16.\r\nIf the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability provided above cannot be given local legal effect according to their terms, reviewing courts shall apply local law that most closely approximates an absolute waiver of all civil liability in connection with the Program, unless a warranty or assumption of liability accompanies a copy of the Program in return for a fee.\r\n\r\nEND OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\r\n\r\nHow to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs\r\nIf you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.\r\n\r\nTo do so, attach the following notices to the program. It is safest to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively state the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the \"copyright\" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.\r\n\r\n    <one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.>\r\n    Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>\r\n\r\n    This program is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify\r\n    it under the terms of the GNU Affero General Public License as\r\n    published by the Free Software Foundation, either version 3 of the\r\n    License, or (at your option) any later version.\r\n\r\n    This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,\r\n    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of\r\n    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the\r\n    GNU Affero General Public License for more details.\r\n\r\n    You should have received a copy of the GNU Affero General Public License\r\n    along with this program.  If not, see <http://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.\r\nAlso add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.\r\n\r\nIf your software can interact with users remotely through a computer network, you should also make sure that it provides a way for users to get its source. For example, if your program is a web application, its interface could display a \"Source\" link that leads users to an archive of the code. There are many ways you could offer source, and different solutions will be better for different programs; see section 13 for the specific requirements.\r\n\r\nYou should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or school, if any, to sign a \"copyright disclaimer\" for the program, if necessary. For more information on this, and how to apply and follow the GNU AGPL, see <http://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.", notes: nil, similar_license_id: nil},

No license is granted to the trademarks of Licensor even if such marks are included in the Original Work. Nothing in this License shall be interpreted to prohibit Licensor from licensing under terms different from this License any Original Work that Licensor otherwise would have a right to license.\r\n\r\n5) External Deployment. The term \"External Deployment\" means the use, distribution, or communication of the Original Work or Derivative Works in any way such that the Original Work or Derivative Works may be used by anyone other than You, whether those works are distributed or communicated to those persons or made available as an application intended for use over a network. As an express condition for the grants of license hereunder, You must treat any External Deployment by You of the Original Work or a Derivative Work as a distribution under section 1(c).\r\n\r\n6) Attribution Rights. You must retain, in the Source Code of any Derivative Works that You create, all copyright, patent, or trademark notices from the Source Code of the Original Work, as well as any notices of licensing and any descriptive text identified therein as an \"Attribution Notice.\" You must cause the Source Code for any Derivative Works that You create to carry a prominent Attribution Notice reasonably calculated to inform recipients that You have modified the Original Work.\r\n\r\n7) Warranty of Provenance and Disclaimer of Warranty. The Original Work is provided under this License on an \"AS IS\" BASIS and WITHOUT WARRANTY, either express or implied, including, without limitation, the warranties of non-infringement, merchantability or fitness for a particular purpose. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY OF THE ORIGINAL WORK IS WITH YOU. This DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY constitutes an essential part of this License. No license to the Original Work is granted by this License except under this disclaimer.\r\n\r\n8) Limitation of Liability. Under no circumstances and under no legal theory, whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise, shall the Licensor be liable to anyone for any direct, indirect, special, incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a result of this License or the use of the Original Work including, without limitation, damages for loss of goodwill, work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all other commercial damages or losses. This limitation of liability shall not apply to the extent applicable law prohibits such limitation.\r\n\r\n9) Acceptance and Termination. If, at any time, You expressly assented to this License, that assent indicates your clear and irrevocable acceptance of this License and all of its terms and conditions. If You distribute or communicate copies of the Original Work or a Derivative Work, You must make a reasonable effort under the circumstances to obtain the express assent of recipients to the terms of this License. This License conditions your rights to undertake the activities listed in Section 1, including your right to create Derivative Works based upon the Original Work, and doing so without honoring these terms and conditions is prohibited by copyright law and international treaty. Nothing in this License is intended to affect copyright exceptions and limitations (including \"fair use\" or \"fair dealing\"). This License shall terminate immediately and You may no longer exercise any of the rights granted to You by this License upon your failure to honor the conditions in Section 1(c).\r\n\r\n10) Termination for Patent Action. This License shall terminate automatically and You may no longer exercise any of the rights granted to You by this License as of the date You commence an action, including a cross-claim or counterclaim, against Licensor or any licensee alleging that the Original Work infringes a patent. This termination provision shall not apply for an action alleging patent infringement by combinations of the Original Work with other software or hardware.\r\n\r\n11) Jurisdiction, Venue and Governing Law. Any action or suit relating to this License may be brought only in the courts of a jurisdiction wherein the Licensor resides or in which Licensor conducts its primary business, and under the laws of that jurisdiction excluding its conflict-of-law provisions. The application of the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods is expressly excluded. Any use of the Original Work outside the scope of this License or after its termination shall be subject to the requirements and penalties of copyright or patent law in the appropriate jurisdiction. This section shall survive the termination of this License.\r\n\r\n12) Attorneys' Fees. In any action to enforce the terms of this License or seeking damages relating thereto, the prevailing party shall be entitled to recover its costs and expenses, including, without limitation, reasonable attorneys' fees and costs incurred in connection with such action, including any appeal of such action.

If any provision of this License is held to be unenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only to the extent necessary to make it enforceable.\r\n\r\n14) Definition of \"You\" in This License. \"You\" throughout this License, whether in upper or lower case, means an individual or a legal entity exercising rights under, and complying with all of the terms of, this License. For legal entities, \"You\" includes any entity that controls, is controlled by, or is under common control with you. For purposes of this definition, \"control\" means (i) the power, direct or indirect, to cause the direction or management of such entity, whether by contract or otherwise, or (ii) ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the outstanding shares, or (iii) beneficial ownership of such entity.\r\n\r\n15) Right to Use. You may use the Original Work in all ways not otherwise restricted or conditioned by this License or by law, and Licensor promises not to interfere with or be responsible for such uses by You.\r\n\r\n16) Modification of This License. This License is Copyright © 2005 Lawrence Rosen. Permission is granted to copy, distribute, or communicate this License without modification. Nothing in this License permits You to modify this License as applied to the Original Work or to Derivative Works. However, You may modify the text of this License and copy, distribute or communicate your modified version (the \"Modified License\") and apply it to other original works of authorship subject to the following conditions: (i) You may not indicate in any way that your Modified License is the \"Open Software License\" or \"OSL\" and you may not use those names in the name of your Modified License; (ii) You must replace the notice specified in the first paragraph above with the notice \"Licensed under <insert your license name here>\" or with a notice of your own that is not confusingly similar to the notice in this License; and (iii) You may not claim that your original works are open source software unless your Modified License has been approved by Open Source Initiative (OSI) and You comply with its license review and certification process.\r\n\r\n17) Non-Profit Amendment. The name of this amended version of the Open Software License (\"OSL 3.0\") is \"Non-Profit Open Software License 3.0\". The original OSL 3.0 license has been amended as follows:\r\n\r\n(a) Licensor represents and declares that it is a not-for-profit organization that derives no revenue whatsoever from the distribution of the Original Work or Derivative Works thereof, or from support or services relating thereto.\r\n\r\n(b) The first sentence of Section 7 [\"Warranty of Provenance\"] of OSL 3.0 has been stricken. For Original Works licensed under this Non-Profit OSL 3.0, LICENSOR OFFERS NO WARRANTIES WHATSOEVER.\r\n\r\n(c) In the first sentence of Section 8 [\"Limitation of Liability\"] of this Non-Profit OSL 3.0, the list of damages for which LIABILITY IS LIMITED now includes \"direct\" damages.\r\n\r\n(d) The proviso in Section 1(c) of this License now refers to this \"Non-Profit Open Software License\" rather than the \"Open Software License\". You may distribute or communicate the Original Work or Derivative Works thereof under this Non-Profit OSL 3.0 license only if You make the representation and declaration in paragraph (a) of this Section 17. Otherwise, You shall distribute or communicate the Original Work or Derivative Works thereof only under the OSL 3.0 license and You shall publish clear licensing notices so stating. Also by way of clarification, this License does not authorize You to distribute or communicate works under this Non-Profit OSL 3.0 if You received them under the original OSL 3.0 license.\r\n\r\n(e) Original Works licensed under this license shall reference \"Non-Profit OSL 3.0\" in licensing notices to distinguish them from works licensed under the original OSL 3.0 license.\r\n", notes: nil, similar_license_id: nil},

This occurred\r\nany time an entity did not release their application to a \"third party\".\r\n\r\nWhile there is a certain freedom in this model of licensing, it struck the\r\nauthors of the RPL as being unfair to the open source community at large and to\r\nthe original authors of the works in particular. After all, bug fixes,\r\nextensions, and meaningful and valuable derivatives were not consistently\r\nfinding their way back into the community where they could fuel further, and\r\nfaster, growth and expansion of the overall open source software base.\r\n\r\nWhile you should clearly read and understand the entire license, the essence of\r\nthe RPL is found in two definitions: \"Deploy\" and \"Required Components\".\r\n\r\nRegarding deployment, under the RPL your changes, bug fixes, extensions, etc.\r\nmust be made available to the open source community at large when you Deploy in\r\nany form -- either internally or to an outside party. Once you start running\r\nthe software you have to start sharing the software.\r\n\r\nFurther, under the RPL all components you author including schemas, scripts,\r\nsource code, etc. -- regardless of whether they're compiled into a single\r\nbinary or used as two halves of client/server application -- must be shared.\r\nYou have to share the whole pie, not an isolated slice of it.\r\n\r\nIn addition to these goals, the RPL was authored to meet the requirements of\r\nthe Open Source Definition as maintained by the Open Source Initiative (OSI). \r\n\r\nThe specific terms and conditions of the license are defined in the remainder\r\nof this document.\r\n\r\n\r\nLICENSE TERMS \r\n\r\n1.0 General; Applicability & Definitions. This Reciprocal Public License\r\nVersion 1.5 (\"License\") applies to any programs or other works as well as any\r\nand all updates or maintenance releases of said programs or works (\"Software\")\r\nnot already covered by this License which the Software copyright holder\r\n(\"Licensor\") makes available containing a License Notice (hereinafter defined)\r\nfrom the Licensor specifying or allowing use or distribution under the terms of\r\nthis License.

You may not modify or delete any pre-existing copyright notices,\r\nchange notices or License text in the Licensed Software without written\r\npermission of the respective Licensor or Contributor.\r\n\r\n6.3 Intellectual Property Matters. \r\n\r\na. Third Party Claims. If You have knowledge that a license to a third party's\r\nintellectual property right is required to exercise the rights granted by this\r\nLicense, You must include a human-readable file with Your distribution that\r\ndescribes the claim and the party making the claim in sufficient detail that a\r\nrecipient will know whom to contact.\r\n\r\nb. Contributor APIs. If Your Extensions include an application programming\r\ninterface (\"API\") and You have knowledge of patent licenses that are\r\nreasonably necessary to implement that API, You must also include this\r\ninformation in a human-readable file supplied with Your distribution. \r\n\r\nc. Representations. You represent that, except as disclosed pursuant to 6.3(a)\r\nabove, You believe that any Extensions You distribute are Your original\r\ncreations and that You have sufficient rights to grant the rights conveyed by\r\nthis License. \r\n\r\n6.4 Required Notices. \r\n\r\na. License Text. You must duplicate this License or instructions on how to\r\nacquire a copy in any documentation You provide along with the Source Code of\r\nany Extensions You create or to which You contribute, wherever You describe\r\nrecipients' rights relating to Licensed Software.\r\n\r\nb. License Notice. You must duplicate any notice contained in EXHIBIT A (the\r\n\"License Notice\") in each file of the Source Code of any copy You distribute\r\nof the Licensed Software and Your Extensions. If You create an Extension, You\r\nmay add Your name as a Contributor to the Source Code and accompanying\r\ndocumentation along with a description of the contribution. If it is not\r\npossible to put the License Notice in a particular Source Code file due to its\r\nstructure, then You must include such License Notice in a location where a\r\nuser would be likely to look for such a notice.\r\n\r\nc. Source Code Availability. You must notify the software community of the\r\navailability of Source Code to Your Extensions within one (1) month of the date\r\nYou initially Deploy and include in such notification a description of the\r\nExtensions, and instructions on how to acquire the Source Code. Should such\r\ninstructions change you must notify the software community of revised\r\ninstructions within one (1) month of the date of change. You must provide\r\nnotification by posting to appropriate news groups, mailing lists, weblogs, or\r\nother sites where a publicly accessible search engine would reasonably be\r\nexpected to index your post in relationship to queries regarding the Licensed\r\nSoftware and/or Your Extensions.\r\n\r\nd. User-Visible Attribution. You must duplicate any notice contained in\r\nEXHIBIT B (the \"User-Visible Attribution Notice\") in each user-visible display\r\nof the Licensed Software and Your Extensions which delineates copyright,\r\nownership, or similar attribution information. If You create an Extension,\r\nYou may add Your name as a Contributor, and add Your attribution notice, as an\r\nequally visible and functional element of any User-Visible Attribution Notice\r\ncontent. To ensure proper attribution, You must also include such User-Visible\r\nAttribution Notice in at least one location in the Software documentation\r\nwhere a user would be likely to look for such notice.\r\n\r\n6.5 Additional Terms. You may choose to offer, and charge a fee for, warranty,\r\nsupport, indemnity or liability obligations to one or more recipients of\r\nLicensed Software. However, You may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on\r\nbehalf of the Licensor or any Contributor except as permitted under other\r\nagreements between you and Licensor or Contributor. You must make it clear that\r\nany such warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligation is offered by You\r\nalone, and You hereby agree to indemnify the Licensor and every Contributor for\r\nany liability plus attorney fees, costs, and related expenses due to any such\r\naction or claim incurred by the Licensor or such Contributor as a result of\r\nwarranty, support, indemnity or liability terms You offer.\r\n\r\n6.6 Conflicts With Other Licenses. Where any portion of Your Extensions, by\r\nvirtue of being Derivative Works of another product or similar circumstance,\r\nfall under the terms of another license, the terms of that license should be\r\nhonored however You must also make Your Extensions available under this\r\nLicense. If the terms of this License continue to conflict with the terms of\r\nthe other license you may write the Licensor for permission to resolve the\r\nconflict in a fashion that remains consistent with the intent of this License.\r\nSuch permission will be granted at the sole discretion of the Licensor. \r\n\r\n7.0 Versions of This License. Licensor may publish from time to time revised\r\nversions of the License. Once Licensed Software has been published under a\r\nparticular version of the License, You may always continue to use it under the\r\nterms of that version. You may also choose to use such Licensed Software under\r\nthe terms of any subsequent version of the License published by Licensor. No\r\none other than Licensor has the right to modify the terms applicable to\r\nLicensed Software created under this License.\r\n\r\n7.1 If You create or use a modified version of this License, which You may do\r\nonly in order to apply it to software that is not already Licensed Software\r\nunder this License, You must rename Your license so that it is not confusingly\r\nsimilar to this License, and must make it clear that Your license contains\r\nterms that differ from this License. In so naming Your license, You may not\r\nuse any trademark of Licensor or of any Contributor. Should Your modifications\r\nto this License be limited to alteration of a) Section 13.8 solely to modify\r\nthe legal Jurisdiction or Venue for disputes, b) EXHIBIT A solely to define\r\nLicense Notice text, or c) to EXHIBIT B solely to define a User-Visible\r\nAttribution Notice, You may continue to refer to Your License as the\r\nReciprocal Public License or simply the RPL.\r\n\r\n8.0 Disclaimer of Warranty.

THIS LIMITATION OF LIABILITY SHALL NOT APPLY TO LIABILITY FOR DEATH\r\nOR PERSONAL INJURY RESULTING FROM SUCH PARTY'S NEGLIGENCE TO THE EXTENT\r\nAPPLICABLE LAW PROHIBITS SUCH LIMITATION. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE\r\nEXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO THIS\r\nEXCLUSION AND LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU. \r\n\r\n10.0 High Risk Activities. THE LICENSED SOFTWARE IS NOT FAULT-TOLERANT AND IS\r\nNOT DESIGNED, MANUFACTURED, OR INTENDED FOR USE OR DISTRIBUTION AS ON-LINE\r\nCONTROL EQUIPMENT IN HAZARDOUS ENVIRONMENTS REQUIRING FAIL-SAFE PERFORMANCE,\r\nSUCH AS IN THE OPERATION OF NUCLEAR FACILITIES, AIRCRAFT NAVIGATION OR\r\nCOMMUNICATIONS SYSTEMS, AIR TRAFFIC CONTROL, DIRECT LIFE SUPPORT MACHINES, OR\r\nWEAPONS SYSTEMS, IN WHICH THE FAILURE OF THE LICENSED SOFTWARE COULD LEAD\r\nDIRECTLY TO DEATH, PERSONAL INJURY, OR SEVERE PHYSICAL OR ENVIRONMENTAL DAMAGE\r\n(\"HIGH RISK ACTIVITIES\"). LICENSOR AND CONTRIBUTORS SPECIFICALLY DISCLAIM ANY\r\nEXPRESS OR IMPLIED WARRANTY OF FITNESS FOR HIGH RISK ACTIVITIES. \r\n\r\n11.0 Responsibility for Claims. As between Licensor and Contributors, each\r\nparty is responsible for claims and damages arising, directly or indirectly,\r\nout of its utilization of rights under this License which specifically\r\ndisclaims warranties and limits any liability of the Licensor. This paragraph\r\nis to be used in conjunction with and controlled by the Disclaimer Of\r\nWarranties of Section 8, the Limitation Of Damages in Section 9, and the\r\ndisclaimer against use for High Risk Activities in Section 10. The Licensor\r\nhas thereby disclaimed all warranties and limited any damages that it is or\r\nmay be liable for. You agree to work with Licensor and Contributors to\r\ndistribute such responsibility on an equitable basis consistent with the terms\r\nof this License including Sections 8, 9, and 10. Nothing herein is intended or\r\nshall be deemed to constitute any admission of liability. \r\n\r\n12.0 Termination. This License and all rights granted hereunder will terminate\r\nimmediately in the event of the circumstances described in Section 13.6 or if\r\napplicable law prohibits or restricts You from fully and or specifically\r\ncomplying with Sections 3, 4 and/or 6, or prevents the enforceability of any\r\nof those Sections, and You must immediately discontinue any use of Licensed\r\nSoftware. \r\n\r\n12.1 Automatic Termination Upon Breach. This License and the rights granted\r\nhereunder will terminate automatically if You fail to comply with the terms\r\nherein and fail to cure such breach within thirty (30) days of becoming aware\r\nof the breach. All sublicenses to the Licensed Software that are properly\r\ngranted shall survive any termination of this License. Provisions that, by\r\ntheir nature, must remain in effect beyond the termination of this License,\r\nshall survive. \r\n\r\n12.2 Termination Upon Assertion of Patent Infringement. If You initiate\r\nlitigation by asserting a patent infringement claim (excluding declaratory\r\njudgment actions) against Licensor or a Contributor (Licensor or Contributor\r\nagainst whom You file such an action is referred to herein as \"Respondent\")\r\nalleging that Licensed Software directly or indirectly infringes any patent,\r\nthen any and all rights granted by such Respondent to You under Sections 3 or\r\n4 of this License shall terminate prospectively upon sixty (60) days notice\r\nfrom Respondent (the \"Notice Period\") unless within that Notice Period You\r\neither agree in writing (i) to pay Respondent a mutually agreeable reasonably\r\nroyalty for Your past or future use of Licensed Software made by such\r\nRespondent, or (ii) withdraw Your litigation claim with respect to Licensed\r\nSoftware against such Respondent. If within said Notice Period a reasonable\r\nroyalty and payment arrangement are not mutually agreed upon in writing by the\r\nparties or the litigation claim is not withdrawn, the rights granted by\r\nLicensor to You under Sections 3 and 4 automatically terminate at the\r\nexpiration of said Notice Period. \r\n\r\n12.3 Reasonable Value of This License. If You assert a patent infringement\r\nclaim against Respondent alleging that Licensed Software directly or\r\nindirectly infringes any patent where such claim is resolved (such as by\r\nlicense or settlement) prior to the initiation of patent infringement\r\nlitigation, then the reasonable value of the licenses granted by said\r\nRespondent under Sections 3 and 4 shall be taken into account in determining\r\nthe amount or value of any payment or license. \r\n\r\n12.4 No Retroactive Effect of Termination. In the event of termination under\r\nthis Section all end user license agreements (excluding licenses to\r\ndistributors and resellers) that have been validly granted by You or any\r\ndistributor hereunder prior to termination shall survive termination. \r\n\r\n13.0 Miscellaneous. \r\n\r\n13.1 U.S. Government End Users.

The words are different, but the goal is the same - to guarantee for all users the freedom to share and change software.  If anyone wonders about the meaning of the SimPL, they should interpret it as consistent with GPL 2.0.\r\nSimple Public License (SimPL) 2.0\r\nThe SimPL applies to the software's source and object code and comes with any rights that I have in it (other than trademarks). You agree to the SimPL by copying, distributing, or making a derivative work of the software.\r\n\r\nYou get the royalty free right to:\r\nUse the software for any purpose;\r\nMake derivative works of it (this is called a \"Derived Work\");\r\nCopy and distribute it and any Derived Work.\r\nIf you distribute the software or a Derived Work, you must give back to the community by:\r\nProminently noting the date of any changes you make;\r\nLeaving other people's copyright notices, warranty disclaimers, and license terms  in place;\r\nProviding the source code, build scripts, installation scripts, and interface definitions in a form that is easy to get and best to modify;\r\nLicensing it to everyone under SimPL, or substantially similar terms (such as GPL 2.0), without adding further restrictions to the rights provided;\r\nConspicuously announcing that it is available under that license.\r\nThere are some things that you must shoulder:\r\nYou get NO WARRANTIES. None of any kind;\r\nIf the software damages you in any way, you may only recover direct damages up to the amount you paid for it (that is zero if you did not pay anything). You may not recover any other damages, including those called \"consequential damages.\" (The state or country where you live may not allow you to limit your liability in this way, so this may not apply to you);\r\nThe SimPL continues perpetually, except that your license rights end automatically if:\r\nYou do not abide by the \"give back to the community\" terms (your licensees get to keep their rights if they abide);\r\nAnyone prevents you from distributing the software under the terms of the SimPL.\r\nLicense for the License\r\nYou may do anything that you want with the SimPL text; it's a license form to use in any way that you find helpful.  To avoid confusion, however, if you change the terms in any way then you may not call your license the Simple Public License or the SimPL (but feel free to acknowledge that your license is \"based on the Simple Public License\").", notes: nil, similar_license_id: nil},

API conformance is highly measurable and suppliers who claim it must be able to substantiate that claim.\r\n\r\nAs such, since these are benchmark measures of conformance, we feel the integrity of test tools is of importance. In order to preserve the integrity of the existing conformance modes of this test package and to permit recipients of modified versions of this package to run the original test modes, this license requires that the original test modes be preserved.\r\n\r\nIf you find a bug in one of the standards mode test cases, please let us know so we can feed this back into the original, and also raise any specification issues with the appropriate bodies (for example the POSIX committees).\r\n\r\nDefinitions:\r\n\r\n\"Package\" refers to the collection of files distributed by the Copyright Holder, and derivatives of that collection of files created through textual modification.\r\n\"Standard Version\" refers to such a Package if it has not been modified, or has been modified in accordance with the wishes of the Copyright Holder.\r\n\"Copyright Holder\" is whoever is named in the copyright or copyrights for the package. \"You\" is you, if you're thinking about copying or distributing this Package.\r\n\"Reasonable copying fee\" is whatever you can justify on the basis of media cost, duplication charges, time of people involved, and so on. (You will not be required to justify it to the Copyright Holder, but only to the computing community at large as a market that must bear the fee.)\r\n\"Freely Available\" means that no fee is charged for the item itself, though there may be fees involved in handling the item. It also means that recipients of the item may redistribute it under the same conditions they received it.\r\n1. You may make and give away verbatim copies of the source form of the Standard Version of this Package without restriction, provided that you duplicate all of the original copyright notices and associated disclaimers.\r\n\r\n2. You may apply bug fixes, portability fixes and other modifications derived from the Public Domain or from the Copyright Holder. A Package modified in such a way shall still be considered the Standard Version.\r\n\r\n3. You may otherwise modify your copy of this Package in any way, provided that you insert a prominent notice in each changed file stating how and when you changed that file, and provided that you do at least the following:\r\n\r\nrename any non-standard executables and testcases so the names do not conflict with standard executables and testcases, which must also be provided, and provide a separate manual page for each non-standard executable and testcase that clearly documents how it differs from the Standard Version.\r\n\r\n4. You may distribute the programs of this Package in object code or executable form, provided that you do at least the following:\r\n\r\naccompany any non-standard executables and testcases with their corresponding Standard Version executables and testcases, giving the non-standard executables and testcases non-standard names, and clearly documenting the differences in manual pages (or equivalent), together with instructions on where to get the Standard Version.\r\n\r\n5. You may charge a reasonable copying fee for any distribution of this Package. You may charge any fee you choose for support of this Package. You may not charge a fee for this Package itself. However, you may distribute this Package in aggregate with other (possibly commercial) programs as part of a larger (possibly commercial) software distribution provided that you do not advertise this Package as a product of your own.\r\n\r\n6. The scripts and library files supplied as input to or produced as output from the programs of this Package do not automatically fall under the copyright of this Package, but belong to whomever generated them, and may be sold commercially, and may be aggregated with this Package.\r\n\r\n7.Subroutines supplied by you and linked into this Package shall not be considered part of this Package.\r\n\r\n8. The name of the Copyright Holder may not be used to endorse or promote products derived from this software without specific prior written permission.\r\n\r\n9.

Nothing in this agreement shall be construed to limit either party's right to independently develop or distribute software that is functionally similar to the other party's products, so long as proprietary information of the other party is not included in such software.\r\n\r\nOpen Source \r\n\"Open Source\" software - software available without charge for use, modification and distribution - is often licensed under terms that require the user to make the user's modifications to the Open Source software or any software that the user 'combines' with the Open Source software freely available in source code form. If you use Open Source software in conjunction with the programs, you must ensure that your use does not: (i) create, or purport to create, obligations of us with respect to the Oracle programs; or (ii) grant, or purport to grant, to any third party any rights to or immunities under our intellectual property or proprietary rights in the Oracle programs. For example, you may not develop a software program using an Oracle program and an Open Source program where such use results in a program file(s) that contains code from both the Oracle program and the Open Source program (including without limitation libraries) if the Open Source program is licensed under a license that requires any \"modifications\" be made freely available.

  {name: "GPL2 w/ CPE", description: "GPL v2 with Class Exception", version: "", category_id: 4, license_type_id: 2, flag_osi: false, text_license: "The GNU General Public License (GPL) Version 2, June 1991\r\n\r\nCopyright (C) 1989, 1991 Free Software Foundation, Inc.\r\n59 Temple Place, Suite 330, Boston, MA 02111-1307 USA\r\n\r\nEveryone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies\r\nof this license document, but changing it is not allowed.\r\n\r\nPreamble\r\n\r\nThe licenses for most software are designed to take away your freedom to share and change it. By contrast, the GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free software--to make sure the software is free for all its users. This General Public License applies to most of the Free Software Foundation's software and to any other program whose authors commit to using it. (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered by the GNU Library General Public License instead.) You can apply it to your programs, too.\r\n\r\nWhen we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price. Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.\r\n\r\nTo protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights. These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.\r\n\r\nFor example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that you have. You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code. And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.\r\n\r\nWe protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and (2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the software.\r\n\r\nAlso, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free software. If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original authors' reputations.\r\n\r\nFinally, any free program is threatened constantly by software patents. We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free program will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the program proprietary. To prevent this, we have made it clear that any patent must be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.\r\n\r\nThe precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modification follow.\r\n\r\nTERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION\r\n\r\n0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed under the terms of this General Public License. The \"Program\", below, refers to any such program or work, and a \"work based on the Program\" means either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another language. (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in the term \"modification\".) Each licensee is addressed as \"you\".\r\n\r\nActivities other than copying, distribution and modification are not covered by this License; they are outside its scope. The act of running the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the Program (independent of having been made by running the Program). Whether that is true depends on what the Program does.\r\n\r\n1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty; and give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License along with the Program.\r\n\r\nYou may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.\r\n\r\n2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion of it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1 above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:\r\n\r\na) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.\r\nb) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third parties under the terms of this License.\r\nc) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively when run, you must cause it, when started running for such interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this License. (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but does not normally print such an announcement, your work based on the Program is not required to print an announcement.)\r\nThese requirements apply to the modified work as a whole. If identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program, and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those sections when you distribute them as separate works. But when you distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based on the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.\r\n\r\nThus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or collective works based on the Program.\r\n\r\nIn addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under the scope of this License.\r\n\r\n3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:\r\n\r\na) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,\r\nb) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,\r\nc) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer to distribute corresponding source code. (This alternative is allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you received the program in object code or executable form with such an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)\r\nThe source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for making modifications to it. For an executable work, complete source code means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation and installation of the executable. However, as a special exception, the source code distributed need not include anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies the executable.\r\n\r\nIf distribution of executable or object code is made by offering access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the source code from the same place counts as distribution of the source code, even though third parties are not compelled to copy the source along with the object code.\r\n\r\n4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program except as expressly provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License. However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.\r\n\r\n5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not signed it. However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or distribute the Program or its derivative works. These actions are prohibited by law if you do not accept this License. Therefore, by modifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying the Program or works based on it.\r\n\r\n6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to these terms and conditions. You may not impose any further restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein. You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to this License.\r\n\r\n7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues), conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not excuse you from the conditions of this License. If you cannot distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may not distribute the Program at all. For example, if a patent license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to refrain entirely from distribution of the Program.\r\n\r\nIf any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.\r\n\r\nIt is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the integrity of the free software distribution system, which is implemented by public license practices. Many people have made generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed through that system in reliance on consistent application of that system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot impose that choice.\r\n\r\nThis section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to be a consequence of the rest of this License.\r\n\r\n8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the original copyright holder who places the Program under this License may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus excluded. In such case, this License incorporates the limitation as if written in the body of this License.\r\n\r\n9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of the General Public License from time to time. Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.\r\n\r\nEach version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Program specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and \"any later version\", you have the option of following the terms and conditions either of that version or of any later version published by the Free Software Foundation. If the Program does not specify a version number of this License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software Foundation.\r\n\r\n10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author to ask for permission. For software which is copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this. Our decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.\r\n\r\nNO WARRANTY\r\n\r\n11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM \"AS IS\" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.\r\n\r\n12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.\r\n\r\nEND OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\r\n\r\nHow to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs\r\n\r\nIf you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.\r\n\r\nTo do so, attach the following notices to the program. It is safest to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the \"copyright\" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.\r\n\r\nOne line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.\r\nCopyright (C) <year> <name of author>\r\nThis program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by the Free Software Foundation; either version 2 of the License, or (at your option) any later version.\r\nThis program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful, but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. See the GNU General Public License for more details.\r\nYou should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License along with this program; if not, write to the Free Software Foundation, Inc., 59 Temple Place, Suite 330, Boston, MA 02111-1307 USA\r\nAlso add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.\r\n\r\nIf the program is interactive, make it output a short notice like this when it starts in an interactive mode:\r\n\r\nGnomovision version 69, Copyright (C) year name of author Gnomovision comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w'. This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it under certain conditions; type `show c' for details.\r\nThe hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the appropriate parts of the General Public License. Of course, the commands you use may be called something other than `show w' and `show c'; they could even be mouse-clicks or menu items--whatever suits your program.\r\n\r\nYou should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your school, if any, to sign a \"copyright disclaimer\" for the program, if necessary. Here is a sample; alter the names:\r\n\r\nYoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the program `Gnomovision' (which makes passes at compilers) written by James Hacker.\r\nsignature of Ty Coon, 1 April 1989\r\nTy Coon, President of Vice\r\nThis General Public License does not permit incorporating your program into proprietary programs. If your program is a subroutine library, you may consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with the library. If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Library General Public License instead of this License.\r\n\r\n\"CLASSPATH\" EXCEPTION TO THE GPL VERSION 2\r\n\r\nCertain source files distributed by Oracle are subject to the following clarification and special exception to the GPL Version 2, but only where Oracle has expressly included in the particular source file's header the words \"Oracle designates this particular file as subject to the \"Classpath\" exception as provided by Oracle in the License file that accompanied this code.\" \r\n\r\nLinking this library statically or dynamically with other modules is making a combined work based on this library.  Thus, the terms and conditions of the GNU General Public License Version 2 cover the whole combination. \r\n\r\nAs a special exception, the copyright holders of this library give you permission to link this library with independent modules to produce an executable, regardless of the license terms of these independent modules, and to copy and distribute the resulting executable under terms of your choice, provided that you also meet, for each linked independent module, the terms and conditions of the license of that module.  An independent module is a module which is not derived from or based on this library.  If you modify this library, you may extend this exception to your version of the library, but you are not obligated to do so.  If you do not wish to do so, delete this exception statement from your version.\r\n\r\n\r\n", notes: "estratto da: http://programmers.stackexchange.com/questions/119436/what-does-gpl-with-classpath-exception-mean-in-practice\r\n\r\nGPL with classpath exception behaves like LGPL for most uses.\r\nIt does mean you need to be able to ship the source for the library on demand. It does not mean you need to be able to ship your own source.

Software contains application Testing software components\r\n(\"Verifier\") for your convenience.  However, you may not use the Sun\r\ntagline \"J2EE(TM) Verified\" or similar phrase designated by Sun to\r\nindicate your application's satisfaction of the J2EE Application\r\nVerification Criteria (\"verification Tagline\") based on the use of\r\nSoftware or Verifier under this Agreement.  To obtain the right to\r\nuse a Verification Tagline, you must license the J2EE Application\r\nVerification Kit from Sun, pay applicable fees, and execute a\r\nseparate trademark license for the Verification Tagline.\r\n\r\nL.  Refer to the appropriate version of the Java Runtime Environment\r\nbinary code license (currently located at\r\nhttp://www.java.sun.com/j2se) for the availability of runtime code\r\nwhich may be distributed with your applications.\r\n\r\nM.   Termination for Infringement.  Either party may terminate this\r\nAgreement immediately should any Software become, or in either\r\nparty's opinion be likely to become, the subject of a claim of\r\ninfringement of any intellectual property right.\r\n\r\nN.  Notice of Automatic Downloads.  You acknowledge that, by your\r\nuse of Software and/or requesting services that require use of\r\nSoftware, Software may automatically download, install, and execute\r\nsoftware applications from sources other than Sun (\"Other\r\nSoftware\").  Sun makes no representations of a relationship of any\r\nkind to licensors of Other Software.  TO THE EXTENT NOT PROHIBITED\r\nBY LAW, IN NO EVENT WILL SUN OR ITS LICENSORS BE LIABLE FOR ANY LOST\r\nREVENUE, PROFIT OR DATA, OR FOR SPECIAL, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL,\r\nINCIDENTAL OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES, HOWEVER CAUSED REGARDLESS OF THE\r\nTHEORY OF LIABILITY, ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO THE USE OF OR\r\nINABILITY TO USE OTHER SOFTWARE, EVEN IF SUN HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE\r\nPOSSIBILTY OF SUCH DAMAGES.\r\n\r\nO.  You may not publish or provide the results of any benchmark or\r\ncomparison tests run on Software to any third party without the\r\nprior written consent of Sun.\r\n\r\nP.   You may use the HTTP engine ONLY in connection with serving\r\nJ2EE applications,unless you have paid in full all corresponding\r\nfees and charges in connection with a license for the Application\r\nServer 7 Standard Edition. Furthermore, unless you have paid in full\r\nall corresponding fees and charges in connection with a license for\r\nthe Application Server 7 Standard Edition, you may NOT use the CGI,\r\nNSAPI, SHTML and Access Control List features.\r\n\r\nQ.  If Software includes either the Sun ONE or iPlanet Directory\r\nServer software bundled or embedded (\"DSS\"), you may use such DSS\r\nonly if you have paid in full all corresponding fees and charges in\r\nconnection with a license for the Application Server 7 Standard\r\nEdition.  Your use of such DSS is limited to the storage of an:  a)\r\nunlimited number of Entries solely to store usernames, password, and\r\ngroup IDs accessed by Software's user authentication and\r\nauthorization features; and b) a limited number of Entries solely to\r\nstore the configuration information required by Applications running\r\non Software, provided that in no event shall any Application have\r\nmore than 1,000 such Entries.\r\n\r\nStorage of any information (including without limitation contact\r\ninformation and user preferences) except as otherwise explicitly\r\nprovided in this section, or access to DSS from other software\r\nproducts on a stand-alone basis requires purchase of a DSS license.\r\n\r\nSection I:  Secondary Supplemental Terms for SunTM ONE Application\r\nServer 7 Standard Edition for Development Update 2\r\n\r\nIf you obtain a license key to enable the Application Server\r\nStandard Edition Features without having paid in full all\r\ncorresponding fees and charges in connection with a license for the\r\nApplication Server 7 Standard Edition, the additional terms and\r\nconditions found in this Section I apply in addition to the Base\r\nAgreement. Capitalized terms not defined herein shall have the\r\nmeanings ascribed to them in the Base Agreement. These terms shall\r\nsupersede any inconsistent or conflicting terms in the Base\r\nAgreement.  1. Additional Features\r\n\r\nYou may use the Standard Edition Features solely for internal\r\ndevelopment.\r\n\r\n2.  No Production Use.  You have no right to use the Standard\r\nEdition Features in an internally accessible or externally\r\naccessible production environment, for commercial use, or for\r\noperational purposes.  Nor may you use the Standard Edition Features\r\nfor staging or quality assurance purposes. For the purposes of this\r\nsection, quality assurance and staging involves exposing instance(s)\r\nof Software to end users and/or testers for testing an application\r\nprior to production, or staging an application prior to production.\r\nIf you wish to deploy Software in a production environment or for\r\ntesting and quality assurance purposes, you must do one of the\r\nfollowing:  a. disable the Standard Edition Features using the\r\nPlatform Edition key; or b. purchase a license for the Application\r\nServer 7 Standard Edition. In that event, the  terms and conditions\r\nfound in Section II (below) apply.\r\n\r\n\r\nSection II:  Secondary Supplemental Terms for SunTM ONE Application\r\nServer 7 Standard Edition Update 2\r\n\r\n\r\nIf you have paid in full all corresponding fees and charges in\r\nconnection with a license for the Application Server 7 Standard\r\nEdition Update 2, the additional terms and conditions found in this\r\nSection II apply in addition to the Base License.  Capitalized terms\r\nnot defined herein shall have the meanings ascribed to them in the\r\nBase Agreement. These terms shall supersede any inconsistent or\r\nconflicting terms in the Base Agreement.\r\n\r\n1.      Definitions.\r\n\r\n\tA.   \"Application(s)\" means a unit of software deployed in\r\n\tthe form of a J2EE Enterprise Archive (EAR) file or as a\r\n\tJ2EE module.  A J2EE module is either a Web Archive (WAR)\r\n\tfile or an EJB JAR file.\r\n\r\n\tB.      \"Designated CPU(s)\" means the single central\r\n\tprocessing unit (\"CPU\") upon which Software is executed.\r\n\r\n\tC.      \"Entry(ies)\" means a representation of a single\r\n\tconceptual or real-world object stored in the directory\r\n\tserver contained in the DSS (as defined below) which has a\r\n\tdistinguished name that is unique in your enterprise.\r\n\r\n\r\n2.  Additional Features\r\n\r\nYou may use (including in a production environment) Software with or\r\nwithout the Standard Edition Features enabled only on the number of\r\nDesignated CPU(s) for which you have paid the corresponding fee for\r\nsuch usage.  Software may be installed on a computer system with\r\nmore CPUs than the number licensed if (i) the corresponding\r\nadditional fees are paid prior to such installation and you provide\r\nSun with the make, model, operating system and number of CPUs of the\r\nnew or reconfigured system or (ii) Software cannot access or use\r\nCPUs for which you have not paid the corresponding fees.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSunONE/Application Server7 PE/SEU2 02JUN03/HBF\r\n\r\n", notes: "estratto da: https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/software/page/eupl/eupl-compatible-open-source-licences#section-3\r\n\r\nIn Europe, lawyers (i.e. Till Jaeger in OSI licence discussions, September 2013) understanding of the directive is that software, that is independently created and exchanges information with other software through an interface, is independent software and not a derivative work. The directive permits reproduction of the portion of code (data formats, APIs) that are necessary for implementing this interoperability. From the perspective of European copyright law, the Court of Justice of the European Union will therefore (most probably) consider that linking software for interoperability (= for exchanging information) makes no derivatives and that the way of linking (statically producing a single binary or dynamic at runtime) is a technical modality without substantial importance regarding copyright. On this specific point, the European copyright law contradicts the perspective of the GPLv2 (because of the wording of sec. 2 GPLv2), while on other points the GPL was validated by European courts.", similar_license_id: 101},

This is a modified version of the BSD license. You may be more familiar with the Gnu Public License, since it gets a lot of press. Well, forget about that. The BSD license is very different. While the Gnu license puts all sorts of restrictions on what you can do with the software, BSD-style licenses say \"Hey, do what you like, we don't care. Just let people know we wrote it, and don't sue us.\" That's really all there is to it. The first paragraph with the numbered items says you can do what you like with the code, as long as you keep our name on it. The original BSD license had a couple more provisions there, we got rid of those. The second paragraph, all in capital letters, is a standard legal boilerplate notification that tries to make it difficult for anyone to successfully sue us over the software.\r\n\r\nBy the way, FreshMeat has a nice list of different types of freeware licenses. There are quite a few besides BSD and GPL. There's also the OpenSource.org list of open source licenses, which is not quite the same as the freeware licenses.\r\n\r\nHere are some questions people ask about the license:\r\n\r\n\"Can I use your software in a freeware product?\"\r\nSure.\r\n\"Can I use your software in a commercial product? Do I have to pay you?\"\r\nYes you can, and no you don't have to, although we certainly won't object to any checks you care to send our way.\r\n\"If I use your software as part of my product, do I have to include your source code? Or my source code?\"\"\r\nNo. You're thinking of the Gnu license. Our license just says that if you distribute our source code then you must leave in the license text; but you are free to use it in binary-only form if you like, and put the license text in your documentation instead.\r\n\"Can I make my own version of your software?\"\r\nOf course.\r\n\"Can I distribute my own version of your software?\"\r\nYes, although unless it's just a repackaging we'd prefer that you didn't. Having multiple versions of the same thing floating around is inherently distasteful. If you absolutely must distribute your own modified version of our software, please name it something else to avoid confusing people.\r\n\"Would you please send me a signed disclaimer, so my company's lawyers are happy?\"\r\nNo. The license in the source code is sufficient.\r\n\"We don't want to put your license in our documentation or distribute your source, can we use your software anyway?\"\r\nWe occasionally grant special permission for this sort of thing. A donation to ACME Labs will probably improve the chances.", similar_license_id: 2},

If your client pays you a one-time fee to create the site/product, that's perfectly fine and qualifies under the \"no charge\" license. If end users are charged a usage/access/license fee, please sign up for a \"Business Green\" Club GreenSock membership which comes with a comprehensive commercial license. See http://www.greensock.com/club/ for details.\r\nUse at your own risk. No warranties are offered.\r\nPlease respect the copyright.\r\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nLEGALESE:\r\n\r\nThis is a legal agreement between you (either an individual or a single entity) and GreenSock, Inc. (\"GREENSOCK\") for the proprietary GreenSock code known as TweenLite, TweenMax, TweenNano, TimelineLite, TimelineMax, and other copyrighted code that is available for download at http://www.greensock.com (this code and documentation, as well as any updates which may at GREENSOCK's sole discretion be provided to you from time to time, are referred to in this Agreement as \"PROGRAM\"). By downloading, copying, or otherwise using the PROGRAM, you agree to the terms and conditions of this Agreement. If you do not agree to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, please do not download or use the PROGRAM.\r\n\r\nI. LICENSE\r\nA. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, GREENSOCK hereby grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, non-transferable right to use the PROGRAM in apps, web sites, games, components and other software applications (\"Developed Works\") for which the end user is NOT charged any fees. If you would like to use the code in a commercially licensed Developed Work for which end users are charged a fee (either for usage or access), simply sign up for the appropriate \"Business Green\" Club GreenSock membership at http://www.greensock.com/club/.\r\n\r\nII. LIMITATION OF LICENSE AND RESTRICTIONS \r\nA. You agree that you will not sell, rent, or license the PROGRAM's source code or any derivative works thereof to any third party without the prior written consent of GREENSOCK. Distribution of the PROGRAM as part of your Developed Work is acceptable so long as it is used exclusively as a part of your Developed Work. You agree not to modify or delete GREENSOCK'S existing copyright notices located in the source code.\r\n\r\nB. You may use, duplicate, and distribute the compiled object code as embedded in Developed Works created by you, either for your own use or for distribution to a third party so long as end users of the Developed Work are not charged a fee for usage of or access to any portion of the Developed Work. Please see http://www.greensock.com/licensing/ for descriptions of Developed Works that qualify for the \"No Charge\" license.\r\n\r\nC. You may make modifications to the source code exclusively for your own use in order to perform bug fixes or other minor edits required to operate the PROGRAM as originally intended.\r\n\r\nIII. CONSIDERATION\r\nA. The license rights granted to you under this Agreement are at no charge, but only in the following circumstances: If on your own behalf or on behalf of a third party you incorporate the PROGRAM into a web site, app, game, program or any component thereof (collectively, \"Developed Work\"), which in the case of a web site, must be accessible to internet users without payment of a fee of any kind, and in the case of a software application, game, program or component, neither you nor anyone to whom you distribute the Developed Work charges a user a fee of any kind to use such Developed Work or application, game, program or component into which such Developed Work is embedded. The foregoing shall apply regardless of whether you are paid to create such Developed Work.\r\n\r\nB. In the event your intended use of the PROGRAM does not meet the criteria for the \"no charge\" license rights set forth in the immediately preceding paragraph, then you are not licensed to use the PROGRAM under this Agreement and must license the PROGRAM under GREENSOCK'S separate fee-based Software License Agreement which is granted to \"Business Green\" Club GreenSock members (see http://www.greensock.com/club/ for details).\r\n\r\nC. You may make modifications to the source code exclusively for your own use in order to perform bug fixes or other minor edits required to operate the PROGRAM as originally intended.\r\n\r\nIV. TITLE AND OWNERSHIP \r\nThe PROGRAM is licensed, not sold, and is protected by copyright laws and international treaty provisions. You acknowledge that no title to the intellectual property in the PROGRAM is transferred to you. You further acknowledge that title and full ownership rights to the PROGRAM, including all intellectual property rights therein, will remain the exclusive property of GREENSOCK and you will not acquire any rights to the PROGRAM except as expressly set forth in this Agreement. You agree that any copies of the PROGRAM you make will contain the same proprietary notices which appear on and in the PROGRAM. You agree that GREENSOCK may identify you as a licensee unless you make a written request otherwise. GREENSOCK hereby grants to you the right to disclose that your product, game, software application, component, or other Developed Work makes use of GREENSOCK code (for example, \"Powered by TweenLite\").\r\n\r\nV. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY AND LIMITATION OF LIABILITY \r\nA. THE PROGRAM IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. GREENSOCK DOES NOT WARRANT THAT THE FUNCTIONS CONTAINED IN THE PROGRAM WILL MEET YOUR REQUIREMENTS OR THAT OPERATION WILL BE UNINTERRUPTED OR ERROR FREE. GREENSOCK shall not be liable for special, indirect, incidental, or consequential damages with respect to any claim on account of or arising from this Agreement or use of the PROGRAM, even if GREENSOCK has been or is hereafter advised of the possibility of such damages. Because some states do not allow certain exclusions or limitations on implied warranties or of liability for consequential or incidental damages, the above exclusions may not apply to you. In no event, however, will GREENSOCK be liable to you, under any theory of recovery, in an amount in excess of $250. Notwithstanding anything else in this agreement, you agree to indemnify GREENSOCK, its assignees, and licensees, and hold each of them harmless from and against any and all claims, losses, damages, and expenses, including legal fees arising out of or resulting from any negligent act or omission by you.\r\n\r\nB. GREENSOCK may, at its sole discretion, provide support services related to the PROGRAM, but has no obligation to do so.\r\n\r\nVI. TERMINATION\r\nIf you at any time fail to abide by the terms of this Agreement, GREENSOCK shall have the right to immediately terminate the license granted herein and pursue any other legal or equitable remedies available.\r\n\r\nVII. MISCELLANEOUS \r\nA. This Agreement shall be construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Illinois. In the event of any dispute between you and GREENSOCK with respect to this Agreement, we both agree that if we cannot resolve the dispute in good faith discussion, either of us may submit the dispute for resolution to arbitration with the American Arbitration Association before a single arbitrator using the AAA Rules for Commercial Arbitration. The arbitrator's decision is final and can be enforced in any court with jurisdiction over such matters.\r\n\r\nB. This agreement represents the complete and exclusive statement of the agreement between GREENSOCK and you and supersedes all prior agreements, proposals, representations and other communications, verbal or written, between them with respect to use of the program. This agreement may be modified only with the mutual written approval of authorized representatives of the parties.\r\n\r\nC.

  {name: "Atlassian", description: "ATLASSIAN END USER AGREEMENT", version: "", category_id: nil, license_type_id: 5, flag_osi: true, text_license: "Atlassian products are proprietary software applications. Your use of Atlassian products is subject to the terms and conditions as outlined in the End User Agreement (PDF).\r\n\r\nATLASSIAN END USER AGREEMENT\r\n\r\nIMPORTANT – PLEASE READ THIS AGREEMENT!\r\n\r\nThis End User Agreement (\"Agreement\") is a binding legal document between Atlassian and you, which explains your rights and obligations as an End User of Atlassian products. \"End User\" means either (a) you as an individual or (b) your company, if you are using Atlassian products in your capacity as an employee or agent of a company. You identify the specific \"End User\" during the registration process. \"Atlassian\" means Atlassian Pty Ltd (ABN 53 102 443 916) of Level 6, 341 George Street, Sydney, NSW 2000, Australia.\r\nBy allowing the \"I Agree to the terms and conditions of the End User Agreement\" box to remain checked, or by installing or using any Atlassian products, End User agrees to be bound by this Agreement. If you do not agree to this Agreement, then uncheck the \"I Accept\" box and do not install or use Atlassian products.\r\nThe \"Agreement\" also includes any Atlassian policies or documents referenced in this document, including Atlassian's Privacy Policy at http://www.atlassian.com/company/privacy.\r\nFrom time to time, Atlassian may modify this Agreement, including any referenced policies and other documents. Any modified version will be effective at the time it is posted. To keep abreast of your license rights and relevant restrictions, please bookmark this Agreement and read it periodically. By using any Product after any modifications, End User agrees to all of the modifications.\r\n1. Introduction to Atlassian's Products and License Terms.\r\n\r\n1.1 What's Included in \"Software\". Atlassian offers many different software products for download, including JIRA, Confluence, and others. \"Software\" means any Atlassian product that End User orders from Atlassian (or an Atlassian Expert, as described below) and downloads from Atlassian. The term also includes (a) related documentation, (b) any Updates (defined below) to the Software, (c) any add-ons, plug-ins, APIs or Internet-based components of the Software provided by Atlassian (but not third parties) (\"Supplementary Software\"), and (d) any third party software embedded in or provided with Atlassian's software (\"Embedded Software\"). End User's detailed rights to use Software are in Section 2 below. To be clear, any add-ons, plug-ins, APIs or other code offered by third parties (through the Atlassian Marketplace or otherwise) or created by End User itself are not \"Software\", and Atlassian is not responsible for and does not offer any warranty, indemnity or support for those items.\r\n\r\n1.2 What's Included in \"Hosted Services\". \"Hosted Services\" include any Atlassian online services products that End User orders, which can include \"OnDemand\" versions of many Atlassian Software products, the Bitbucket hosting service (\"Bitbucket\"), and other online services provided by Atlassian. \"Hosted Services\" always means the version of the Hosted Services as described in Atlassian's then-current product descriptions. End User's detailed rights to use Hosted Services are in Section 3 below.\r\n\r\n1.3 The \"Products\". This Agreement uses \"Products\" to refer to the Software and/or the Hosted Services.\r\n\r\n1.4 Atlassian's Maintenance Offerings. For additional fees, Atlassian offers \"Maintenance\" to End Users as described at http://confluence.atlassian.com/display/Support/Atlassian+Support+Offerings. Maintenance includes (1) any generally released updates, upgrades, patches, and bug fixes for the Software (\"Updates\") when and if generally released at Atlassian's sole discretion, (2) web-based support and phone support (depending on End User's support level) as described in the link above, and (3) other support features as described in the link above.\r\n\r\n1.5 Limits on Authorized Users. When buying a license to the Software or a subscription to the Hosted Services, End User pays fees for a specific number of users, which are counted based on number of then-authorized users for Software and number of seats or logins for Hosted Services (\"Authorized Users\"). End User designates Authorized Users through the Products. Authorized Users may include End User's employees, representatives, consultants, contractors, agents, and Customers (note: detailed rules for Customers in Section 4.4 below). End User may add Authorized Users for additional fees. End User is responsible for all use of the Products by its Authorized Users and their compliance with this Agreement.\r\n\r\n1.6 Purchase through \"Atlassian Experts\" (Resellers). Fees are payable directly to Atlassian as described in Section 5 (Fees and Payment) below unless End User ordered the Products from an Atlassian authorized reseller (\"Atlassian Experts\"). If End User ordered Products from an Atlassian Expert, then the sections of this Agreement referring to orders with Atlassian or payments to Atlassian do not apply for those Products. Instead, End User agrees to pay the Atlassian Expert the fees separately agreed with the Atlassian Expert. No Atlassian Expert may change the terms of this Agreement (but they may impose additional restrictions on use of the Products). No promises, warranties or agreements by Atlassian Experts are binding on Atlassian.\r\n\r\n1.7 Purchase through Atlassian Marketplace. Unless Atlassian is the publisher, use of Marketplace Products purchased through the Atlassian Marketplace are not governed by this Agreement but are instead governed by the Marketplace Terms of Use located at http://www.atlassian.com/licensing/marketplace/termsofuse.\r\n\r\n2. License to Use Atlassian Software.\r\n\r\n2.1 Software, Generally. Atlassian grants End User a worldwide, non-exclusive, non-transferable, non-sublicenseable right to use the Software, subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement. Software licenses are perpetual unless terminated as described in this Agreement. Only Authorized Users may use the Software, and only up to the permitted number of concurrent Authorized Users (except for Non-Production Purposes, as described below). All use of Software must be in accordance with the relevant Atlassian documentation and policies. End User may make a limited number of copies of the Software as is strictly necessary for purposes of data protection, archiving, backup, and testing and internal development (e.g., of End User Modifications or End-User Plug-ins, as defined below, but not development of End User's unrelated products or services) (\"Non-Production Purposes\"). For clarity, End User's employees and contractors may use the Software for these Non-Production Purposes, and End User will be responsible for their compliance with this Agreement on all the same terms as for Authorized Users, except that these users will not count against End User's limit of Authorized Users, and End User will not need to pay additional fees for these users. Unless Atlassian agrees otherwise in writing, End User may only install, use or make available the Software on End User's hardware systems, whether owned, leased or controlled. End User will be responsible for any use of the Software on any hardware systems not owned, leased or controlled by End User (\"Uncontrolled Systems\").\r\n\r\n2.2 Updates and Supplementary Software. The terms for Software in this Agreement apply to any Updates and Supplementary Software, unless Atlassian provides different terms. Atlassian may cease making available Supplementary Software and Internet-based services used with the Software (e.g., the Atlassian Plugin Checkup tool) at any time.\r\n\r\n2.3 Open Source Software. The Software may contain or be provided with components subject to the terms and conditions of \"open source\" software licenses (\"Open Source Software\"). To the extent required by the license that accompanies the Open Source Software, the terms of such license will apply in lieu of the terms of this Agreement with respect to such Open Source Software, including any provisions governing access to source code, modification or reverse engineering.\r\n\r\n2.4 Evaluation Software. This paragraph applies to any Software that Atlassian makes available on an evaluation basis (\"Evaluation Software\"). End User may only use the Evaluation Software for internal evaluation purposes for the period specified by Atlassian (or, if not specified, for 30 days), and may only permit a limited number of users (specified by Atlassian) to access the Evaluation Software. After the evaluation period, End User must delete all copies of the Evaluation Software. End User acknowledges that Evaluation Software may not be fully functional. Notwithstanding anything else in this Agreement, Atlassian does not offer any warranty, indemnity or support for any Evaluation Software.\r\n\r\n2.5 Source Code. Atlassian may provide some elements of Software in source code form (\"Source Code\"). Unless otherwise specified, End User may modify Source Code solely to develop bug fixes, customizations, and additional features (\"End User Modifications\") and, notwithstanding anything else in this Agreement, may only use End User Modifications internally for purposes of using the Software licensed from Atlassian. Atlassian will have no support, warranty, indemnity or other obligations relating to, and assumes no liability for, any End User Modifications or any effect they may have on the operation of the Products.\r\n\r\n2.6 IP Protection Mechanisms. The Software has license protection mechanisms designed to manage and protect Atlassian's and its suppliers' and licensors' intellectual property rights. Whether using Source Code or not, End User must not modify or alter these mechanisms or try to circumvent them or the usage rules they are designed to enforce.\r\n\r\n3. Use of Atlassian Hosted Services.\r\n\r\n3.1 Access Rights. End User may access and use the Hosted Services during the applicable Subscription Term (defined below), subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement. Only Authorized Users may use the Hosted Services, and only up to the permitted number of Authorized Users. All use of the Hosted Services must be in accordance with the relevant Atlassian documentation and policies.\r\n\r\n3.2 Subscription and Renewals. End User selects its initial subscription term, which may be a month, quarter, year, or other mutually agreed period, at the time of order. Once that term expires, it will automatically renew for successive terms of the same period (but no longer than 1 year each) unless either End User or Atlassian notifies the other of non-renewal at least 5 business days prior to the upcoming expiration date or Atlassian ceases to make a particular Hosted Service available. Renewals are charged at Atlassian's then-current rates unless otherwise agreed, and Atlassian will at its discretion charge End User using the credit card on file on or after the expiration date or send End User an invoice. \"Subscription Term\" means the initial term and any renewal term(s).\r\n\r\n3.3 Evaluations. For evaluations of Hosted Services, the \"Subscription Term\" does not apply. Instead, the evaluation period is specified by Atlassian. Atlassian may notify End User of the remaining number of days through the Hosted Services. Notwithstanding anything else in this Agreement, Atlassian does not offer any warranty, indemnity or support for any Hosted Services offered on an evaluation basis.\r\n\r\n3.4 End User Data. Unless otherwise specified, End User retains ownership of any data or other content or information that End User provides through the Hosted Services, including any code uploaded to Bitbucket (as described below) (\"End User Data\"). End User's use of the Hosted Services and all End User Data must comply with End User's own privacy policies and all domestic, foreign and international laws and regulations, including those relating to data privacy, international communications, and the exportation of technical or personal data. End User is solely responsible for the accuracy, content and legality of all End User Data. End User agrees not to submit any content that is obscene, defamatory, libelous, threatening, harassing, pornographic, racially or ethnically offensive, that encourages conduct that would be considered a criminal offense or give rise to any civil liability. End User will not submit any material (including any virus, bot, worm, scripting exploit or other harmful code) that is likely to harm or corrupt the Hosted Services or any computer systems or data. End User represents and warrants to Atlassian that it has sufficient rights in the End User Data to grant the rights in this section and that the End User Data does not infringe the rights of any third party. End User agrees that Atlassian may, in its sole discretion, delete or remove any End User Data at any time and with or without notice.\r\n\r\nEnd User hereby grants Atlassian a non-exclusive license to copy, distribute, perform, display, store, modify, and otherwise use End User Data in connection with operating the Hosted Services.\r\n\r\nAtlassian may also use aggregate information to measure general Hosted Service usage patterns and characteristics of its user base and otherwise to improve its products and services, and may include such aggregate information about its audience in promotional materials or reports to third parties. This aggregate information will not reference names, phone numbers, email addresses, or other personally identifiable information, and it will be not traceable to a specific recipient or user email address.\r\n\r\n3.5 Special Terms for Bitbucket. This paragraph applies to Bitbucket. If End User runs a Bitbucket repository, End User represents and warrants that it will accurately designate both the license under which the code in the repository is licensed to third parties and the project license for any contributions by collaborators. Project collaborators should carefully read all third party licenses before using any code or contributing any code. End User agrees to use Bitbucket solely as a code repository and not to upload any other content to Bitbucket (e.g., music or video). END USER ACKNOWLEDGES THAT ALL CODE MADE AVAILABLE THROUGH BITBUCKET IS THE RESPONSIBILITY OF THE ENTITY THAT MAKES IT AVAILABLE. ATLASSIAN IS NOT THE LICENSOR OF ANY THIRD PARTY CODE MADE AVAILABLE THROUGH BITBUCKET AND TAKES NO RESPONSIBILITY FOR SUCH CODE.\r\n\r\n3.6 Storage Limits. Atlassian sells 1 GB blocks of storage for End User Data at the rates specified when End User orders Hosted Services. Use in excess of purchased storage will count as an overage, and any overages are charged at $1.00 per month for the next 1 GB block or Atlassian's then-current rate. Atlassian may create or modify maximum storage limits for the Hosted Services at any time, in its discretion, and End User acknowledges that it may not receive notices about these limits. Note: This paragraph does not apply to storage on Bitbucket.\r\n\r\n3.7 Return of End User Data. After termination or expiration of a Subscription Term or this Agreement, unless it was for End User's breach, at End User's request, Atlassian will use reasonable efforts to make available the End User Data for download. If made available, End User must download the End User Data within 30 days of termination or expiration. After that, Atlassian may delete the End User Data.\r\n\r\n3.8 End User Responsibility for Systems. End User is responsible for its own Internet connection and must use software, systems and equipment compatible with the Hosted Services, as Atlassian specifies in its published policies. Any End User web browsers and other software must support the Secure Socket Layer (SSL) protocol or other protocols accepted by Atlassian. Atlassian's security measures are described at http://www.atlassian.com/hosted/security. Atlassian is not responsible for any End User Data lost, altered, intercepted or stored across networks not owned or operated by Atlassian.\r\n\r\n4. Important Customer Obligations\r\n\r\n4.1 Accounts and Passwords. End User will provide accurate, current and complete information when registering with Atlassian and ordering Products and agrees to update its information if it changes. This is important, because Atlassian may send notices, statements and other information to End User by email or through End User's account (for Hosted Services). End User will keep all its Authorized Users' passwords and usernames confidential and will not share them with third parties. End User is responsible for all actions taken through its accounts.\r\n\r\n4.2 Embedded Software. All of the other restrictions for Software in this Agreement also apply to Embedded Software Software, with the addition of the following terms. End User receives restricted licenses to Embedded Software and may use Embedded Software only for its internal purposes (including for Customer Use as permitted below) in conjunction with the applicable Product as provided by Atlassian, and may only use the Embedded Software as part of and through that Product. End User may not install, access, configure or use any Embedded Software (including any APIs, tools, databases or other components of any Embedded Software) separately or independently of the rest of the Product, whether for production, technical support or any other purposes, or otherwise attempt to gain direct access to any Embedded Software components, or permit anyone else (including Customers) to do any of these things. Notwithstanding any other terms of this Agreement, End User may not modify any Embedded Software. End User will be financially responsible to the applicable third party licensor (\"Embedded Software Licensor\") for all damages and losses resulting from End User's or its Customers' breach of this Agreement. End User may not \"benchmark\" or otherwise analyze performance information for individual Embedded Software elements.\r\n\r\nSome Embedded Software may include source code provided as part of the Embedded Software Licensor's standard shipment. That source code will be governed by the terms for Embedded Software in this Agreement, and not the terms for Source Code in Section 2.5 (Source Code) above.\r\n\r\nEnd User understands that the applicable Embedded Software Licensor retains all ownership and intellectual property rights to the Embedded Software. Embedded Software Licensors (and any other third party licensors of any components of the Products) are intended third party beneficiaries of this Agreement with respect to the items they license and may enforce this Agreement directly against End User; but, to be clear, Embedded Software Licensor do not assume any of Atlassian's obligations under this Agreement. In addition, End User agrees to the Embedded Software-related audit provisions in Section 6 (License Certifications and Audits) below.\r\n\r\nEmbedded Software may include or be accompanied by third party technology that may be appropriate or necessary for use with some Embedded Software. Such technology may be specified in the Documentation or otherwise specified by Atlassian, and is licensed to End User only for use with the Product with which it is provided under the specified third party license terms, and not this Agreement. Atlassian may also provide additional or substitute terms for Embedded Software if required by the Embedded Software Licensor, and End User will comply with those terms.\r\n\r\n4.3 Rules for Plug-ins. End User may develop its own plug-ins for various Products (\"End User Plug-ins\") and may distribute End User Plug-ins to third parties, but only for those Products permitted by Atlassian, and only in accordance with Atlassian's published plug-in and API guidelines. End User Plug-ins distributed through the Atlassian Marketplace will be subject to the posted terms for the Atlassian Marketplace.\r\n\r\n4.4 Use by End User's Customers. End User's customers (\"Customers\") may be Authorized Users. End User will be responsible for Customers the same as any other Authorized User and must enter into valid, binding agreements with Customers consistent with this Agreement, including the additional conditions below. A Customer's permitted use of Products under this Agreement is called \"Customer Use\".\r\n\r\nIn addition to all other terms in this Agreement, the following conditions apply to Customer Use:\r\n\r\n(a) End User may not distribute or make available any Product on a standalone basis. Instead, End User may only make available the Product to Customers in order to support Customers' use of content and features that are part of End User's own existing offerings. Examples would include End User using: (i) Confluence as a tool to provide customer-facing knowledge base articles or technical documentation; (ii) Confluence as a customer-facing extranet for discussions, project updates, and centralized knowledge-sharing source about End User's own products and services unrelated to the Products; (iii) JIRA to collect direct customer feedback on application development (e.g. JIRA Mobile Connect, Bonfire) ; and (iv) JIRA as a customer-facing helpdesk or support system.\r\n\r\n(b) End User may not resell or OEM the Product or otherwise charge Customers for use of the Product itself, but may charge End Users as part of an overall program that includes access to End User content or features as supported by the Product. Example: A paid support offering that includes, as a minor component, access to the support forum.\r\n\r\n(c) Customers may interact with the Product, but may not receive any administrator, configuration or similar access to the Product. Example: Customers may post comments in a JIRA issue, but End User may not permit any Customer to administer project and global site level configurations.\r\n\r\n(d) In making available Products to Customers, End User may not violate any other term or condition in this Agreement, such as reverse engineering and anti-circumvention restrictions.\r\n\r\nAtlassian will not have any direct or indirect liability or obligation to any Customers, and Customers do not acquire any rights under this Agreement.\r\n\r\nAtlassian understands that Product usage may be flexible and that End Users may identify new proposed uses for the Products. If End User has questions about whether a proposed use complies with these rules, please contact Atlassian at sales@atlassian.com.\r\n\r\n4.5 Conditions on Use of Products. End User will not, and will not allow any Authorized User or other third party to: (a) resell, assign, rent, give, transfer, pass title to, lease, copy, provide access to or sublicense (including without limitation on a timeshare, subscription service, hosted service or outsourced basis) any Product to any third party (for use in its business operations or otherwise) or anyone else besides Authorized Users (including Customers) in accordance with this express terms of this Agreement, or permit anyone besides Authorized Users to use any data or information not owned by End User that is generated by the Products (and, in the event End User grants any security interest in any Products, the secured party has no right to use or transfer the Products); (b) use any Product to provide, or incorporate any Product into any product or service provided to, a third party, except as expressly permitted above for Customer Use; (c) reverse engineer, decompile, disassemble, decipher, decrypt, or otherwise seek to discover or obtain the source code or non-public APIs to Products (including any data structure or similar materials produced by the Products), except to the extent expressly permitted by applicable law despite this prohibition (and then only upon advance notice to Atlassian); (d) modify, adapt or create derivative works of a Product (excluding End User Modifications and End User Plug-ins); (e) remove or obscure any proprietary or other notices of Atlassian or any third party contained in any Product (including any information or data generated by the Products); (f) publicly disseminate information regarding the performance of Products; (g) use any Product for commercial solicitation purposes or spam; (h) use the Atlassian name or any Atlassian trademarks or logos except as permitted in Section 4.6 (Attribution); or (i) commit any act or omission that could result in damage to Atlassian's or its suppliers' or licensors' reputations. End User will not attempt to do any of the foregoing, encourage others to do so, or otherwise attempt to bypass or circumvent any usage restrictions in this Agreement.\r\n\r\n4.6 Attribution. In any use of the Software, End User must include the following attribution to Atlassian on all user interfaces in the following format: \"Powered by Atlassian\", which must in every case include a hyperlink to http://www.atlassian.com, and which must be in the same format as delivered in the Software.\r\n\r\n4.7 Export Control. If a Product is acquired in Australia by End User, End User must comply with all applicable Australian export control laws and regulations, including the laws and regulations administered by the Australian Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade (or any replacement department or authority). If a Product is acquired by End User in the United States, End User acknowledges that the Product is subject to U.S. export jurisdiction and agrees to comply with all applicable international and national laws that apply to the Product, including the U.S. Export Administration Regulations, as well as end-user, end-use, and destination restrictions issued by U.S. and other governments. In any case, the import and export of any Product may be subject to control or restriction by applicable local law. End User is solely responsible for determining the existence and application of any such law to any proposed import and export and for obtaining any needed authorization. End User agrees not to export, directly or indirectly, any Product (or any direct product thereof) from any country in violation of applicable laws.\r\n\r\n4.8 Indemnification. End User will indemnify, defend and hold harmless Atlassian from and against any and all claims, costs, damages, losses, liabilities and expenses (including reasonable attorneys' fees and costs) arising out of or in connection with any claim arising from or relating to (a) any breach by End User (including any Authorized Users) of this Agreement, (b) any End User Data, (c) any End User Modifications, End User Plug-ins or other modifications of or combinations with a Product, or any service or product offered by End User in connection with or related to a Product, (d) any Uncontrolled Systems, or (e) any representations or warranties made by End User (including any Authorized User) regarding a Product to third parties. This indemnification obligation is subject to End User receiving (i) prompt written notice of such claim (but in any event notice in sufficient time for End User to respond without prejudice); (ii) the exclusive right to control and direct the investigation, defense, or settlement of such claim, provided that Atlassian may participate in the claim at its own expense and End User may not settle any claim without Atlassian's prior written consent; and (iii) all reasonable necessary cooperation of Atlassian at End User's expense.\r\n\r\n5. Fees and Payment\r\n\r\n5.1 General. End User must pay all fees by their due date specified at the time of order or otherwise within 30 days of Atlassian's invoice or notice. Renewal fees for Hosted Services will be charged as described in Section 3.2 (Subscription and Renewals). Late payments are subject to interest charges of 1.0% per month on any outstanding balance, or the maximum permitted by law, whichever is less, plus all collection expenses. End User will continue to be charged during any period of suspension. In event of any termination, End User will pay the unpaid balance due calculated in accordance with this section and this Agreement. Atlassian may charge such unpaid fees and charges to End User's credit card or otherwise bill End User for such unpaid fees and charges. End User acknowledges that it is not relying on the future availability of any Products (including any Embedded Software) in agreeing to or making its payments hereunder.\r\n\r\n5.2 Taxes. Payments made by End User under this Agreement exclude any taxes or duties payable in respect of the Products in the jurisdiction where the payment is either made or received. To the extent that any such taxes or duties are payable by Atlassian, End User must pay to Atlassian the amount of such taxes or duties in addition to any fees owed under this Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, End User may have obtained an exemption from relevant taxes or duties as of the time such taxes or duties are levied or assessed. In that case, End User will have the right to provide to Atlassian with any such exemption information and Atlassian will use reasonable efforts to provide such invoicing documents as may enable End User to obtain a refund or credit for the amount so paid from any relevant revenue authority if such a refund or credit is available.\r\n\r\n5.3 Special Terms for JIRA Studio and EC2 Hosted Service. End Users of JIRA Studio who wish to make use of Atlassian's Bamboo continuous integration application available within the JIRA Studio development suite must complete a registration with Amazon Web Hosted Services (\"AWS\") for Amazon's Elastic Cloud Hosted Service (EC2) (\"EC2 Hosted Service\"). The EC2 Hosted Service enables End Users to use Elastic Bamboo, which dynamically creates and runs remote agents in the Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, the EC2 Hosted Service is not part of the Hosted Services and fees paid to Atlassian do not include fees for the EC2 Hosted Service. End Users using the EC2 Hosted Service will be charged directly by AWS and will be solely responsible for payment of all fees to AWS. Additional information is available on the EC2 Hosted Service and at: http://www.atlassian.com/software/bamboo/overview/tour/scaling-up, http://confluence.atlassian.com/display/BAMBOO/Elastic+Bamboo+Costs, and http://aws.amazon.com/ec2/.\r\n\r\n6. License Certifications and Audits\r\n\r\nUpon Atlassian's written request, End User will provide Atlassian with a signed certification certifying that all Products are being used pursuant to the terms of this Agreement, including any access and user limitations. With prior reasonable notice of at least ten (10) days, Atlassian (or its authorized agent) may audit the use of the Products by End User and its Authorized Users and any Customers, provided such audit is during regular business hours. End User will provide reasonable assistance and access to information in the course of any audit. End User is responsible for such audit costs only in the event the audit reveals that End User's use of the Products is not in accordance with the permitted scope of use. In the event that any certification or audit reveals that End User has exceeded its permitted number of Authorized Users, Atlassian may invoice End User for any past or ongoing excessive use and End User will pay the invoice in accordance with Section 5 (Fees and Payment). This remedy is without prejudice to any other remedies available to Atlassian at law or equity or under this Agreement.\r\n\r\nEnd User understands that Atlassian may report audit results to any applicable Embedded Software Licensor or may assign the right to audit End User in this Section 6 to Embedded Software Licensors. When the audit is assigned, then notwithstanding anything else in this Agreement to the contrary, End User Licensor will not be responsible for End User's costs incurred in cooperating with the audit.\r\n\r\n7. Atlassian's Ownership Rights; Feedback\r\n\r\nAtlassian and its licensors reserve all rights not expressly granted to End User in this Agreement. The Products (including any content or information contained therein) and all copies thereof are protected by copyright and other intellectual property laws and treaties. Atlassian or its licensors own the title, copyright, and other intellectual property rights in the Products and all copies, modifications and derivative works of the Products and underlying software (including any incorporating Feedback) (\"Atlassian Technology\"), and End User does not acquire any ownership rights in Atlassian Technology. All Products are licensed, not sold.\r\n\r\n\"Feedback\" means any feedback, comments, suggestions or materials (including, to the extent disclosed to Atlassian, any End User Modifications, but excluding End User Plug-ins) that End User may provide to Atlassian about or in connection with the Products, including any ideas, concepts, know-how or techniques contained therein. End User may provide Feedback in connection with Maintenance and otherwise. End User hereby grants Atlassian a worldwide, royalty-free, non-exclusive, perpetual and irrevocable license to use, copy, modify and otherwise exploit the Feedback for any purpose, including incorporating or implementing the Feedback in the Products. End User agrees that Atlassian may exploit all Feedback without any restriction or obligation on account of intellectual property rights or otherwise. For clarity, no Feedback will be deemed End User's Confidential Information, and nothing in this Agreement (including Section 8 (Confidentiality)) limits Atlassian's right to independently use, develop, evaluate, or market products, whether incorporating Feedback or otherwise.\r\n\r\n8. Confidentiality\r\n\r\nExcept as otherwise set forth in Section 7 (Atlassian's Ownership Rights; Feedback) above, each party agrees that all code, inventions, know-how, business, technical and financial information it obtains (\"Receiving Party\") from the disclosing party (\"Disclosing Party\") constitute the confidential property of the Disclosing Party (\"Confidential Information\"), provided that it is identified as confidential at the time of disclosure or should be reasonably known by the Receiving Party to be Confidential Information due to the nature of the information disclosed and the circumstances surrounding the disclosure. Any Atlassian Technology, performance information relating to the Products, and the terms and conditions of this Agreement shall be deemed Confidential Information of Atlassian without any marking or further designation. Except as expressly authorized herein, the Receiving Party will hold in confidence and not use or disclose any Confidential Information. The Receiving Party's nondisclosure obligation shall not apply to information which the Receiving Party can document: (i) was rightfully in its possession or known to it prior to receipt of the Confidential Information; (ii) is or has become public knowledge through no fault of the Receiving Party; (iii) is rightfully obtained by the Receiving Party from a third party without breach of any confidentiality obligation; (iv) is independently developed by employees of the Receiving Party who had no access to such information; or (v) is required to be disclosed pursuant to a regulation, law or court order (but only to the minimum extent required to comply with such regulation or order and with advance notice to the Disclosing Party). The Receiving Party acknowledges that disclosure of Confidential Information would cause substantial harm for which damages alone would not be a sufficient remedy, and therefore that upon any such disclosure by the Receiving Party the Disclosing Party shall be entitled to appropriate equitable relief in addition to whatever other remedies it might have at law.\r\n\r\n9. Termination\r\n\r\nThis Agreement will continue so long as End User has a license to the Software or an ongoing Subscription Term for the Hosted Services, unless earlier terminated. Atlassian may suspend or terminate this Agreement and End User's account, with respect to one or more of the Products, if End User fails to comply with the terms and conditions of this Agreement, including any failure to pay fees when due. Atlassian may terminate any free account or evaluation usage at any time in its sole discretion.\r\n\r\nEnd User may terminate this Agreement at any time with notice to Atlassian.\r\n\r\nImmediately upon termination of any license or subscription right granted under this Agreement, End User's license to Software and Hosted Services will cease, and End User must at its own cost: (a) cease using (and require all Authorized Users, and anyone else to cease using) all the terminated Products; (b) remove all copies of Software from its computer systems and any Uncontrolled Systems; and (c) return to Atlassian all Software or provide Atlassian with written certification that it has destroyed all copies of the Software and other Atlassian Confidential Information in its possession, custody or control. Upon termination of this Agreement for whatever reason, End User will not be entitled to credits or refunds for any unused portion of this Agreement, including but not limited to unused maintenance and support.\r\n\r\nAll payment and other obligations accrued as of the date of any expiration or termination of this Agreement, and Sections 4.5 (Conditions on Use of Products), 4.7 (Export Control), 4.8 (Indemnification), 5 (Fees and Payment), 6 (License Certifications and Audit), 7 (Atlassian's Ownership Rights; Feedback); 8 (Confidentiality), 9 (Termination), 11 (Warranties; Disclaimer of Warranties), 12 (Limitation of Liability), 13 (Publicity Rights) 14 (Assignment), 15 (Governing Law and Arbitration), 16 (DMCA Notices), 17 (Government End Users) and 18 (General) will survive expiration or termination.\r\n\r\n10. Atlassian Infringement Indemnification\r\n\r\nSubject to the remainder of this Section 10, Atlassian will indemnify, defend and hold End User harmless against a claim to the extent based on an allegation that End User's use of a Product (in the form provided by Atlassian) in compliance with this Agreement infringes a United States or European Union patent or registered copyright (\"Claim\"), and will pay those damages and costs finally awarded against End User by a court of competent jurisdiction, or agreed to in writing by Atlassian as settlement, as a result of such Claim, provided that Atlassian is (i) promptly notified and furnished a copy of such Claim, (ii) given all relevant evidence in End User's possession, custody or control, and (iii) given reasonable assistance in and sole control of the defense thereof and all negotiations for its settlement. Atlassian will have no obligation to defend and no liability for any damages or costs to the extent that a Claim is based upon: (i) use of a Product in combination with any non-Atlassian product, software or equipment; (ii) use of a Product in a manner or for an application other than for which it was designed or intended to be used, regardless of whether Atlassian was aware of or had been advised of such use; (iii) modifications to a Product by any person or entity other than Atlassian (including any End User Modifications); or (iv) other circumstances or occurrences that are covered in End User's indemnification obligations in Section 4.8.\r\n\r\nIf a Product becomes, or in the opinion of Atlassian may become, the subject of a Claim, Atlassian may, at its option and in its discretion: (i) procure for End User the right to use the Product free of any liability; (ii) replace or modify the Product to make it non-infringing; or (iii) terminate End User's right to continue using such Product and refund, in the case of Software, any license fees related to this Software paid by End User (depreciated on a three-year straight line basis) or, in the case of a Hosted Service, any prepaid amounts for the service no longer being provided.\r\n\r\nThis Section 10 states the sole liability of Atlassian and the exclusive remedy of End User for any infringement of intellectual property rights in connection with any Product or other items provided by Atlassian under this Agreement.\r\n\r\n11. Warranties; Disclaimers of Warranties\r\n\r\n11.1 General. Each party represents and warrants that it has the legal power and authority to enter into this Agreement, and that, if End User is an entity, this Agreement and each order is entered into by an employee or agent of such party with all necessary authority to bind such party to the terms and conditions of this Agreement.\r\n\r\n11.2 DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTIES.

WITHOUT LIMITING THE FOREGIONG, TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICBLE LAW, ATLASSIAN AND ITS THIRD PARTY SUPPLIERS/LICENSORS MAKE NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES WHATSOEVER WITH RESPECT TO, AND ASSUME NO LIABILITY FOR, ANY PRODUCTS PROVIDED ON AN EVALUATION BASIS. IN ADDITION, ATLASSIAN AND ITS THIRD PARTY LICENSOR/SUPPLIERS SHALL NOT BE LIABLE FOR DELAYS, INTERRUPTIONS, SERVICE FAILURES AND OTHER PROBLEMS INHERENT IN USE OF THE INTERNET AND ELECTRONIC COMMUNICATIONS OR OTHER SYSTEMS OUTSIDE THE REASONABLE CONTROL OF ATLASSIAN.\r\n\r\nEND USER MAY HAVE OTHER STATUTORY RIGHTS. HOWEVER, TO THE FULL EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, THE DURATION OF STATUTORILY REQUIRED WARRANTIES, IF ANY, SHALL BE LIMITED TO THE LIMITED WARRANTY PERIOD.\r\n\r\n11.3 Hosted Services Facilities.

Those who access or use the Hosted Service from other jurisdictions do so at their own volition and are entirely responsible for compliance with all applicable United States and local laws and regulations, including export and import regulations.\r\n\r\n12.

Except in circumstances where a party seeks urgent injunctive relief, before commencing any court proceedings, if any disputes arise under this Agreement the parties will negotiate in good faith to resolve the dispute and if the dispute has not been resolved within sixty (60) calendar days by the relevant parties using their best efforts to resolve the dispute, the dispute will be referred to arbitration and determined under the Rules of Arbitration of the International Chamber of Commerce by one or more arbitrators appointed in accordance with such Rules with any hearings to be held at either the International Commercial Arbitration Center in Sydney (Australia), Amsterdam (Holland) or San Francisco, CA (USA), as mutually agreed by the parties.\r\n\r\n15.3 Exclusion of UN Convention and UCITA.

Government End Users\r\n\r\nThe Products are commercial computer software. If the user or licensee of the Products is an agency, department, or other entity of the United States Government, the use, duplication, reproduction, release, modification, disclosure, or transfer of the Software, or any related documentation of any kind, including technical data and manuals, is restricted by a license agreement or by the terms of this Agreement in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation 12.212 for civilian purposes and Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement 227.7202 for military purposes. The Products were developed fully at private expense. All other use is prohibited.\r\n\r\n18. General\r\n\r\nThis Agreement is the entire agreement between End User and Atlassian relating to the Products and supersedes all prior or contemporaneous oral or written communications, proposals and representations with respect to the Products or any other subject matter covered by this Agreement. If any provision of this Agreement is held to be void, invalid, unenforceable or illegal, the other provisions shall continue in full force and effect. This Agreement may not be modified or amended except as described on the first page of this Agreement or otherwise with the written agreement of Atlassian (which may be withheld in its complete discretion without any requirement to provide reasons). As used herein, \"including\" (and its variants) means \"including without limitation\" (and its variants). If either party to this Agreement breaches any provision of this Agreement relating to Confidential Information or intellectual property rights, there may not be an adequate remedy available solely at law; therefore, an injunction, specific performance or other form of equitable relief or monetary damages or any combination thereof may be sought by the injured party to this Agreement. No failure or delay by the injured party to this Agreement in exercising any right, power or privilege hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall any single or partial exercise thereof preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any right, power or privilege hereunder at law or equity. The parties are independent contractors. This Agreement shall not be construed as constituting either party as a partner of the other or to create any other form of legal association that would give on party the express or implied right, power or authority to create any duty or obligation of the other party.\r\n\r\nShould you have any questions concerning this Agreement, or if you desire to contact Atlassian for any reason, please contact us.", notes: "estratto da: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JIRA\r\n\r\nofficial non-profit organizations, charities, and open-source projects, but not religious organizations", similar_license_id: 101},

  {name: "Google Web Tool", description: "Google Web Toolkit Terms", version: "", category_id: nil, license_type_id: 1, flag_osi: false, text_license: "Google Terms of Service\r\n\r\n1. Your relationship with Google\r\n\r\n1.1 Your use of Google's products, software, services and web sites (referred to collectively as the \"Services\" in this document and excluding any services provided to you by Google under a separate written agreement) is subject to the terms of a legal agreement between you and Google. \"Google\" means Google Inc., whose principal place of business is at 1600 Amphitheatre Parkway, Mountain View, CA 94043, United States. This document explains how the agreement is made up, and sets out some of the terms of that agreement.\r\n\r\n1.2 Unless otherwise agreed in writing with Google, your agreement with Google will always include, at a minimum, the terms and conditions set out in this document. These are referred to below as the \"Universal Terms\".\r\n\r\n1.3 Your agreement with Google will also include the terms of any Legal Notices applicable to the Services, in addition to the Universal Terms. All of these are referred to below as the \"Additional Terms\". Where Additional Terms apply to a Service, these will be accessible for you to read either within, or through your use of, that Service.\r\n\r\n1.4 The Universal Terms, together with the Additional Terms, form a legally binding agreement between you and Google in relation to your use of the Services. It is important that you take the time to read them carefully. Collectively, this legal agreement is referred to below as the \"Terms\".\r\n\r\n1.5 If there is any contradiction between what the Additional Terms say and what the Universal Terms say, then the Additional Terms shall take precedence in relation to that Service.\r\n\r\n2. Accepting the Terms\r\n\r\n2.1 In order to use the Services, you must first agree to the Terms. You may not use the Services if you do not accept the Terms.\r\n\r\n2.2 You can accept the Terms by:\r\n\r\n(A) clicking to accept or agree to the Terms, where this option is made available to you by Google in the user interface for any Service; or\r\n\r\n(B) by actually using the Services. In this case, you understand and agree that Google will treat your use of the Services as acceptance of the Terms from that point onwards.\r\n\r\n2.3 You may not use the Services and may not accept the Terms if (a) you are not of legal age to form a binding contract with Google, or (b) you are a person barred from receiving the Services under the laws of the United States or other countries including the country in which you are resident or from which you use the Services.\r\n\r\n2.4 Before you continue, you should print off or save a local copy of the Universal Terms for your records.\r\n\r\n3. Language of the Terms\r\n\r\n3.1 Where Google has provided you with a translation of the English language version of the Terms, then you agree that the translation is provided for your convenience only and that the English language versions of the Terms will govern your relationship with Google.\r\n\r\n3.2 If there is any contradiction between what the English language version of the Terms says and what a translation says, then the English language version shall take precedence.\r\n\r\n4. Provision of the Services by Google\r\n\r\n4.1 Google has subsidiaries and affiliated legal entities around the world (\"Subsidiaries and Affiliates\"). Sometimes, these companies will be providing the Services to you on behalf of Google itself. You acknowledge and agree that Subsidiaries and Affiliates will be entitled to provide the Services to you.\r\n\r\n4.2 Google is constantly innovating in order to provide the best possible experience for its users. You acknowledge and agree that the form and nature of the Services which Google provides may change from time to time without prior notice to you.\r\n\r\n4.3 As part of this continuing innovation, you acknowledge and agree that Google may stop (permanently or temporarily) providing the Services (or any features within the Services) to you or to users generally at Google's sole discretion, without prior notice to you. You may stop using the Services at any time. You do not need to specifically inform Google when you stop using the Services.\r\n\r\n4.4 You acknowledge and agree that if Google disables access to your account, you may be prevented from accessing the Services, your account details or any files or other content which is contained in your account.\r\n\r\n4.5 You acknowledge and agree that while Google may not currently have set a fixed upper limit on the number of transmissions you may send or receive through the Services or on the amount of storage space used for the provision of any Service, such fixed upper limits may be set by Google at any time, at Google's discretion.\r\n\r\n5. Use of the Services by you\r\n\r\n5.1 In order to access certain Services, you may be required to provide information about yourself (such as identification or contact details) as part of the registration process for the Service, or as part of your continued use of the Services.

EXCLUSION OF WARRANTIES\r\n\r\n14.1 NOTHING IN THESE TERMS, INCLUDING SECTIONS 14 AND 15, SHALL EXCLUDE OR LIMIT GOOGLE'S WARRANTY OR LIABILITY FOR LOSSES WHICH MAY NOT BE LAWFULLY EXCLUDED OR LIMITED BY APPLICABLE LAW.

General legal terms\r\n\r\n20.1 Sometimes when you use the Services, you may (as a result of, or through your use of the Services) use a service or download a piece of software, or purchase goods, which are provided by another person or company. Your use of these other services, software or goods may be subject to separate terms between you and the company or person concerned. If so, the Terms do not affect your legal relationship with these other companies or individuals.\r\n\r\n20.2 The Terms constitute the whole legal agreement between you and Google and govern your use of the Services (but excluding any services which Google may provide to you under a separate written agreement), and completely replace any prior agreements between you and Google in relation to the Services.\r\n\r\n20.3 You agree that Google may provide you with notices, including those regarding changes to the Terms, by email, regular mail, or postings on the Services.\r\n\r\n20.4 You agree that if Google does not exercise or enforce any legal right or remedy which is contained in the Terms (or which Google has the benefit of under any applicable law), this will not be taken to be a formal waiver of Google's rights and that those rights or remedies will still be available to Google.\r\n\r\n20.5 If any court of law, having the jurisdiction to decide on this matter, rules that any provision of these Terms is invalid, then that provision will be removed from the Terms without affecting the rest of the Terms. The remaining provisions of the Terms will continue to be valid and enforceable.\r\n\r\n20.6 You acknowledge and agree that each member of the group of companies of which Google is the parent shall be third party beneficiaries to the Terms and that such other companies shall be entitled to directly enforce, and rely upon, any provision of the Terms which confers a benefit on (or rights in favor of) them. Other than this, no other person or company shall be third party beneficiaries to the Terms.\r\n\r\n20.7 The Terms, and your relationship with Google under the Terms, shall be governed by the laws of the State of California without regard to its conflict of laws provisions. You and Google agree to submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts located within the county of Santa Clara, California to resolve any legal matter arising from the Terms. Notwithstanding this, you agree that Google shall still be allowed to apply for injunctive remedies (or an equivalent type of urgent legal relief) in any jurisdiction.\r\n\r\nApril 16, 2007", notes: "", similar_license_id: 1},

IN ANY CASE, OUR ENTIRE LIABILITY WITH RESPECT TO ANY SUBJECT MATER RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT SHALL BE LIMITED TO THE GREATER OF (I) THE AMOUNT ACTUALLY PAID BY YOU FOR THE SOFTWARE OR (II) FIVE HUNDRED DOLLARS ($500).\r\n\r\n8. VERIFICATION\r\n\r\nWe or a certified auditor acting on Our behalf, may, upon Our reasonable request and at Our expense, audit You with respect to the use of the Software. Such audit may be conducted by mail, electronic means or through an in-person visit to Your place of business. Any such in-person audit shall be conducted during regular business hours at Your facilities and shall not unreasonably interfere with Your business activities. We shall not remove, copy, or redistribute any electronic material during the course of an audit. If an audit reveals that You are using the Software in a way that is in material violation of the terms of this Agreement, then You shall pay Our reasonable costs of conducting the audit. In the case of a material violation, You agree to pay Us any amounts owing that are attributable to the unauthorized use. In the alternative, We reserve the right, at Our discretion, to terminate the licenses for the Software, in addition to any other remedies available under law. This Section shall survive expiration or termination of this Agreement for a period of two (2) years.\r\n\r\n9. PAYMENT AND TAXES\r\n\r\nIf credit has been extended to You by Us, all payments under this Agreement are due within thirty (30) days of the date We mail an invoice to You.

Any value added tax, use tax, sales tax or similar tax (“Transaction Taxes”) shall be your sole responsibility. Each party shall pay all taxes (including, but not limited to, taxes based upon its income) or levies imposed on it under applicable laws, regulations and tax treaties as a result of this Agreement and any payments made hereunder (including those required to be withheld or deducted from payments); provided that You shall be responsible for all Transactions Taxes and shall pay or reimburse Us for the same upon invoice. Each party shall furnish evidence of such paid taxes as is sufficient to enable the other party to obtain any credits available to it, including original withholding tax certificates.

You are not entitled to receive major version updates (i.e. X.Y, X+1.Y) or bug fix updates to the Software (X.Y.Z, X.Y.Z+1), unless purchased independently of this license.\r\n\r\n11. MISCELLANEOUS\r\n\r\nThe license granted herein applies only to the version of the Software available when purchased (or downloaded in the case of Sencha Touch) in connection with the terms of this Agreement, and to any updates and/or upgrades to which you may be entitled. Any previous or subsequent license granted to You for use of the Software shall be governed by the terms and conditions of the agreement entered in connection with purchase or download of that version of the Software. You agree that you will comply with all applicable laws and regulations with respect to the Software, including without limitation all export and re-export control laws and regulations.\r\n\r\nWhile redistributing the Software or Modifications thereof as part of Your Application, You may choose to offer acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity, or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this Agreement. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on our behalf. You shall indemnify Us and our resellers, or at Our option, defend Us and our resellers against any claim, suit or proceeding brought against Us or our resellers (i) arising by reason of Your accepting any such support, warranty, indemnity or additional liability; or (ii) arising out of the use, reproduction or distribution of Your Application, except to the extent such claim is solely based on the inclusion of the Software therein. Further, You agree only to distribute the Software pursuant to an enforceable written agreement for Our benefit that includes all the limitations and restrictions of this Agreement and is as protective of Us and Software as is this Agreement. For clarity, for Software for which you have paid a fee, You must purchase Designated User licenses for each contractor or consultant who uses the Software to create an Application on your behalf (including system integrators), whether or not such contractor or consultant has its own license to the Software.\r\n\r\nYou agree to be identified as a customer of Ours and You agree that We may refer to You by name, trade name and trademark, if applicable, and may briefly describe Your business in our marketing materials and web site.\r\n\r\nYou may not assign or transfer this Agreement without Our prior written consent. This Agreement may be assigned by Us in whole or part and will inure to the benefit of Our successors and assigns. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in any instance in which You transfer ownership of an Application on a work for hire basis, You may assign licenses for the total Designated Users that have used the Software to develop said Application under this Agreement to another party (Assignee) provided (i) you provide written notice to Us prior to the effective date of such assignment; and (ii) there is a written agreement, wherein the Assignee accepts the terms of this Agreement. Upon any such transfer, the Assignee may appoint new Designated Users.\r\n\r\nYou acknowledge that this Agreement is complete and is the exclusive representation of our agreement. No oral or written information given by Us, Our resellers, or otherwise on Our behalf shall create a warranty or collateral contract, or in any way increase the scope of this Agreement in any way, and You may not rely on any such oral or written information. No term or condition contained in any purchase order shall have any force or effect.\r\n\r\nThere are no implied licenses or other implied rights granted under this Agreement, and all rights, save for those expressly granted hereunder, shall remain with Us and our licensors. In addition, no licenses or immunities are granted to the combination of the Software and/or Modifications, as applicable, with any other software or hardware not delivered by Us or Our resellers to You under this Agreement. Your rights under this Agreement apply only to Software, Modifications, and/or Applications for which all Designated Users are duly licensed hereunder.\r\n\r\nIf any provision in this Agreement shall be determined to be invalid, such provision shall be deemed omitted; the remainder of this Agreement shall continue in full force and effect. If any remedy provided is determined to have failed for its essential purpose, all limitations of liability and exclusions of damages set forth in this Agreement shall remain in effect.\r\n\r\nThis Agreement may be modified only by a written instrument signed by an authorized representative of each party. The failure of either party to enforce any provision of this Agreement may not be deemed a waiver of that or any other provision of this Agreement.\r\n\r\nThis Agreement is governed by the law of the State of California, United States (notwithstanding conflicts of laws provisions), and all parties irrevocably submit to the jurisdiction of the state or federal courts of the State of California and further agree to commence any litigation which may arise hereunder in the state or federal courts located in the judicial district of San Mateo County, California, US.\r\n\r\nIf the Software or any related documentation is licensed to the U.S. Government or any agency thereof, it will be considered to be “commercial computer software” or “commercial computer software documentation,” as those terms are used in 48 CFR § 12.212 or 48 CFR § 227.7202, and is being licensed with only those rights as are granted to all other licensees as set forth in this Agreement.", notes: "Il documento con oggetto \" CONTR.

Date January 17, 2001)\r\n\r\nRECITALS\r\n\r\nOriginal Contributor has developed Specifications and Source Code implementations of certain Technology; and\r\n\r\nOriginal Contributor desires to license the Technology to a large community to facilitate research, innovation andproduct development while maintaining compatibility of such products with the Technology as delivered by Original Contributor; and\r\n\r\nOriginal Contributor desires to license certain Sun Trademarks for the purpose of branding products that are compatible with the relevant Technology delivered by Original Contributor; and\r\n\r\nYou desire to license the Technology and possibly certain Sun Trademarks from Original Contributor on the terms and conditions specified in this License.\r\n\r\nIn consideration for the mutual covenants contained herein, You and Original Contributor agree as follows:\r\n\r\nAGREEMENT\r\n\r\n1.  Introduction.  The Sun Community Source License and effective attachments (\"License\") may include five distinct licenses:  Research Use, TCK, Internal Deployment Use, Commercial Use and Trademark License.  The Research Use license is effective when You execute this License.  The TCK\r\nand Internal Deployment Use licenses are effective when You execute this License, unless otherwise specified in the TCK and Internal Deployment Use attachments.  The Commercial Use and Trademark licenses must be signed by You and Original Contributor in order to become effective.  Once effective,\r\nthese licenses and the associated requirements and responsibilities are cumulative.  Capitalized terms used in this License are defined in the Glossary.\r\n\r\n2.  License Grants.\r\n\r\n2.1.  Original Contributor Grant.  Subject to Your compliance with Sections 3, 8.10 and Attachment A of this License, Original Contributor grants to You a worldwide, royalty-free, non-exclusive license, to the extent of Original Contributor's Intellectual Property Rights covering the Original Code, Upgraded Code and Specifications, to do the following:\r\n\r\na) Research Use License:  (i) use, reproduce and modify the Original Code, Upgraded Code and Specifications to create Modifications and Reformatted Specifications for Research Use by You, (ii) publish and display Original Code, Upgraded Code and Specifications with, or as part of Modifications, as permitted under Section 3.1 b) below, (iii) reproduce and distribute copies of Original Code and Upgraded Code to Licensees and students for Research Use by You, (iv) compile, reproduce and distribute Original Code and Upgraded Code in Executable form, and Reformatted Specifications to anyone for Research Use by You.\r\n\r\nb) Other than the licenses expressly granted in this License, Original Contributor retains all right, title, and interest in Original Code and Upgraded Code and Specifications.\r\n2.2.  Your Grants.\r\n\r\na) To Other Licensees.  You hereby grant to each Licensee a license to Your Error Corrections and Shared Modifications, of the same scope and extent as Original Contributor's licenses under Section 2.1 a) above relative to Research Use, Attachment C relative to Internal Deployment Use, and Attachment D relative to Commercial Use.\r\n\r\nb) To Original Contributor.  You hereby grant to Original Contributor a worldwide, royalty-free, non-exclusive, perpetual and irrevocable license, to the extent of Your Intellectual Property Rights covering Your Error Corrections, Shared Modifications and Reformatted Specifications, to use, reproduce, modify, display and distribute Your Error Corrections, Shared Modifications and Reformatted Specifications, in any form, including the right to sublicense such rights through multiple tiers of\r\ndistribution.\r\n\r\nc) Other than the licenses expressly granted in Sections 2.2 a) and b) above, and the restriction set forth in Section 3.1 d)(iv) below, You retain all right, title, and interest in Your Error Corrections, Shared Modifications and Reformatted Specifications.\r\n\r\n2.3.

You may use, reproduce, modify, display and distribute Contributor Error Corrections, Shared Modifications and Reformatted Specifications, obtained by You under this License, to the same scope and extent as with Original Code, Upgraded Code and Specifications.\r\n\r\n2.4.  Subcontracting.  You may deliver the Source Code of Covered Code to other Licensees having at least a Research Use license, for the sole purpose of furnishing development services to You in connection with Your rights granted in this License.  All such Licensees must execute appropriate\r\ndocuments with respect to such work consistent with the terms of this License, and acknowledging their work-made-for-hire status or assigning exclusive right to the work product and associated Intellectual Property Rights to You.\r\n\r\n3.  Requirements and Responsibilities.\r\n\r\n3.1.  Research Use License.  As a condition of exercising the rights granted under Section 2.1 a) above, You agree to comply with the following:\r\n\r\na) Your Contribution to the Community.  All Error Corrections and Shared Modifications which You create or contribute to are automatically subject to the licenses granted under Section 2.2 above.  You are encouraged to license all of Your other Modifications under Section 2.2 as Shared Modifications, but are not required to do so.  You agree to notify Original Contributor of any errors in the Specification.\r\n\r\nb) Source Code Availability.  You agree to provide all Your Error Corrections to Original Contributor as soon as reasonably practicable and, in any event, prior to Internal Deployment Use or Commercial Use, if applicable.  Original Contributor may, at its discretion, post Source Code for Your Error Corrections and Shared Modifications on the Community Webserver.  You may also post Error Corrections and Shared Modifications on a web-server of Your choice; provided, that You must take reasonable precautions to ensure that only Licensees have access to such Error Corrections and Shared Modifications.  Such precautions shall include, without limitation, a password protection scheme limited to Licensees and a click-on, download certification of Licensee status required of those\r\nattempting to download from the server.  An example of an acceptable certification is attached as Attachment A-2.\r\n\r\nc) Notices.  All Error Corrections and Shared Modifications You create or contribute to must include a file documenting the additions and changes You made and the date of such additions and changes.  You must also include the notice set forth in Attachment A-1 in the file header.  If it is not possible to put the notice in a particular Source Code file due to its structure, then You must include the notice in a\r\nlocation (such as a relevant directory file), where a recipient would be most likely to look for such a notice.\r\n\r\nd) Redistribution.\r\n\r\n(i) Source.  Covered Code may be distributed in Source Code form only to another Licensee (except for\r\nstudents as provided below).  You may not offer or impose any terms on any Covered Code that alter the rights, requirements, or responsibilities of such Licensee.  You may distribute Covered Code to students for use in connection with their course work and research projects undertaken at accredited educational institutions.  Such students need not be Licensees, but must be given a copy of the notice set forth in Attachment A-3 and such notice must also be included in a file header or prominent location in the Source Code made available to such students.\r\n\r\n(ii) Executable.  You may distribute Executable version(s) of Covered Code to Licensees and other third parties only for the purpose of evaluation and comment in connection with Research Use by You and under a license of Your choice, but which limits use of such Executable\r\nversion(s) of Covered Code only to that purpose.\r\n\r\n(iii) Modified Class, Interface and Package Naming. In connection with Research Use by You only, You may use Original Contributor's class, interface and package names only to accurately reference or invoke the Source Code files You modify.  Original Contributor grants to You a limited license to the extent necessary for such purposes.\r\n\r\n(iv) Modifications.  You expressly agree that any distribution, in whole or in part, of Modifications\r\ndeveloped by You shall only be done pursuant to the term and conditions of this License.\r\n\r\ne) Extensions.\r\n\r\n(i) Covered Code.  You may not include any Source Code of Community Code in any Extensions;\r\n\r\n(ii) Publication.  No later than the date on which You first distribute such Extension for Commercial Use, You must publish to the industry, on a non-confidential basis and free of all copyright restrictions with respect to reproduction and use, an accurate and current specification for any Extension.  In addition, You must make available an appropriate test suite, pursuant to the same rights as the specification, sufficiently detailed to allow any third party reasonably skilled in the technology to produce implementations of the Extension compatible with the specification.  Such test suites must be made available as soon as reasonably practicable but, in no event, later than ninety (90) days after Your first Commercial Use of the Extension.  You must use reasonable efforts to promptly clarify and correct the specification and the test suite upon written request by Original Contributor.\r\n\r\n(iii) Open.  You agree to refrain from enforcing any Intellectual Property Rights You may have covering any interface(s) of Your Extension, which would prevent the implementation of such interface(s) by Original Contributor or any Licensee.  This obligation does not prevent You from\r\nenforcing any Intellectual Property Right You have that would otherwise be infringed by an implementation of Your Extension.\r\n\r\n(iv) Class, Interface and Package Naming.  You may not add any packages, or any public or protected classes or interfaces with names that originate or might appear to originate from Original Contributor including, without limitation, package or class names which begin with \"sun\", \"java\", \"javax\", \"jini\", \"net.jini\", \"com.sun\" or their equivalents in any subsequent class, interface and/or package naming convention adopted by Original Contributor.  It is specifically suggested that You name any new packages using the \"Unique Package Naming Convention\" as described in \"The Java Language Specification\" by James Gosling, Bill Joy, and Guy Steele, ISBN 0-201-63451-1, August 1996.\r\nSection 7.7 \"Unique Package Names\", on page 125 of this specification which states, in part:\r\n\r\n\"You form a unique package name by first having (or belonging to an organization that has) an Internet domain name, such as \"sun.com\".  You then reverse the name, component by component, to obtain, in this example, \"Com.sun\", and use this as a prefix for Your package names, using a convention developed within Your organization to further administer package names.\"\r\n\r\n3.2.  Additional Requirements and Responsibilities.  Any additional requirements and responsibilities relating to the Technology are listed in Attachment F (Additional Requirements and Responsibilities), if applicable, and are hereby incorporated into this Section 3.\r\n\r\n4.  Versions of the License.\r\n\r\n4.1.  License Versions.  Original Contributor may publish revised versions of the License from time to time.  Each version will be given a distinguishing version number.\r\n\r\n4.2.  Effect.  Once a particular version of Covered Code has been provided under a version of the License, You may always continue to use such Covered Code under the terms of that version of the License.  You may also choose to use such Covered Code under the terms of any subsequent version of\r\nthe License.  No one other than Original Contributor has the right to promulgate License versions.\r\n\r\n5.  Disclaimer of Warranty.\r\n\r\n5.1.  COVERED CODE IS PROVIDED UNDER THIS LICENSE \"AS IS,\" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES THAT THE COVERED CODE IS FREE OF DEFECTS, MERCHANTABLE, FIT FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR NON-INFRINGING.  YOU AGREE TO BEAR THE ENTIRE\r\nRISK IN CONNECTION WITH YOUR USE AND DISTRIBUTION OF COVERED CODE UNDER THIS LICENSE.  THIS DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY CONSTITUTES AN ESSENTIAL PART OF THIS LICENSE.

Effect of Termination.  Upon termination, You agree to discontinue use and return or destroy all copies of Covered Code in your possession.  All sublicenses to the Covered Code which you have properly granted shall survive any termination of this License.  Provisions which, by their nature, should remain in effect beyond the termination of this License shall survive including, without limitation, Sections 2.2, 3, 5, 7 and 8.\r\n\r\n6.4.  Each party waives and releases the other from any claim to compensation or indemnity for permitted or lawful termination of the business relationship established by this License.\r\n\r\n7.  Liability.\r\n\r\n7.1.  Infringement.  Should any of the Original Code, Upgraded Code, TCK or Specifications (\"Materials\") become the subject of a claim of infringement, Original Contributor may, at its sole option, (i) attempt to procure the rights necessary for You to continue using the Materials, (ii) modify the Materials so that they are no longer infringing, or (iii) terminate Your right to use the Materials,\r\nimmediately upon written notice, and refund to You the amount, if any, having then actually been paid by You to Original Contributor for the Original Code, Upgraded Code and TCK, depreciated on a straight line, five year basis.\r\n\r\n7.2.  LIMITATION OF LIABILITY.  TO THE FULL EXTENT ALLOWED BY APPLICABLE LAW, ORIGINAL CONTRIBUTOR'S LIABILITY TO YOU FOR CLAIMS RELATING TO THIS LICENSE, WHETHER FOR BREACH OR IN TORT, SHALL BE LIMITED TO ONE HUNDRED PERCENT (100%) OF THE AMOUNT HAVING THEN ACTUALLY BEEN PAID BY YOU TO ORIGINAL CONTRIBUTOR FOR ALL COPIES LICENSED HEREUNDER OF THE PARTICULAR ITEMS GIVING RISE TO SUCH CLAIM, IF ANY.  IN NO EVENT WILL YOU (RELATIVE TO YOUR SHARED MODIFICATIONS OR ERROR CORRECTIONS) OR ORIGINAL CONTRIBUTOR BE LIABLE FOR ANY INDIRECT, PUNITIVE, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES IN CONNECTION WITH OR ARISING OUT OF THIS LICENSE (INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, LOSS OF PROFITS, USE, DATA, OR OTHER ECONOMIC ADVANTAGE), HOWEVER IT ARISES AND ON ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY, WHETHER IN AN ACTION FOR CONTRACT, STRICT LIABILITY OR TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE) OR OTHERWISE, WHETHER OR NOT YOU OR ORIGINAL CONTRIBUTOR HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGE AND NOTWITHSTANDING THE FAILURE OF ESSENTIAL PURPOSE OF ANY REMEDY.\r\n\r\n8.

Sun introduced the SCSL in 1998 to maintain compatibility within the Java platform and make code available for commercial use.[1] In 2004, Sun began to favor the simpler Java Research License for noncommercial use.[2]\r\nThe SCSL includes elements similar to an open-source license, but it has significant differences, such as a requirement that code is compatible with Java standards and commercial derivative works are subject to licensing fees.

IF YOU ASSERT A PATENT INFRINGEMENT CLAIM AGAINST PARTICIPANT ALLEGING THAT SUCH PARTICIPANT'S CONTRIBUTOR VERSION DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY INFRINGES ANY PATENT WHERE SUCH CLAIM IS RESOLVED (SUCH AS BY LICENSE OR SETTLEMENT) PRIOR TO THE INITIATION OF PATENT INFRINGEMENT LITIGATION, THEN THE REASONABLE VALUE OF THE LICENSES GRANTED BY SUCH PARTICIPANT UNDER SECTIONS 2.1 OR 2.2 SHALL BE TAKEN INTO ACCOUNT IN DETERMINING THE AMOUNT OR VALUE OF ANY PAYMENT OR LICENSE.\r\n\r\n8.4. IN THE EVENT OF TERMINATION UNDER SECTIONS 8.1 OR 8.2 ABOVE, ALL END USER LICENSE AGREEMENTS (EXCLUDING DISTRIBUTORS AND RESELLERS) WHICH HAVE BEEN VALIDLY GRANTED BY YOU OR ANY DISTRIBUTOR HEREUNDER PRIOR TO TERMINATION SHALL SURVIVE TERMINATION.\r\n\r\n9. Limitation of Liability\r\n\r\nUNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES AND UNDER NO LEGAL THEORY, WHETHER TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), CONTRACT, OR OTHERWISE, SHALL YOU, THE INITIAL DEVELOPER, ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR, OR ANY DISTRIBUTOR OF COVERED CODE, OR ANY SUPPLIER OF ANY OF SUCH PARTIES, BE LIABLE TO ANY PERSON FOR ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY CHARACTER INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, DAMAGES FOR LOST PROFITS, LOSS OF GOODWILL, WORK STOPPAGE, COMPUTER FAILURE OR MALFUNCTION, OR ANY AND ALL OTHER COMMERCIAL DAMAGES OR LOSSES, EVEN IF SUCH PARTY SHALL HAVE BEEN INFORMED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. THIS LIMITATION OF LIABILITY SHALL NOT APPLY TO LIABILITY FOR DEATH OR PERSONAL INJURY RESULTING FROM SUCH PARTY'S NEGLIGENCE TO THE EXTENT APPLICABLE LAW PROHIBITS SUCH LIMITATION.

  {name: "customfield", version: "1.0.0", title: "jira-pocketknife-customfield", description: "This library (and reference plugin) provides the framework for best-practice CRUD management of ActiveObjects backed data in JIRA plugins. It could be generalised for all Atlassian plugins, but for now depends on JIRA-specific artefacts. \r\n\r\nThe library contains a number of generic interfaces representing 4-tier data management.\r\n\r\n* ActiveObjectsDao - a model DAO layer over ActiveObjects.\r\n* Manager - a permission ignoring manager layer over the ActiveObjectsDao. Ideally, caching should live here.\r\n* Service - a permission checking service layer over the Manager.\r\n* Resource - a RESTful layer \r\n\r\nEach interface has a simple-case generic abstract implementation (and some have specializations for handling relational mapping). For each AO-backed data type, you will need three representations:\r\n\r\n* An interface extending Entity, representing the AO itself. This must be added to your <ao> entry in your atlassian-plugin.xml.\r\n* A class extending AbstractModel, which must be made immutable (such that it can be stored in a cache).\r\n* A class extending Entry, which must be marshallable by Jersey (ie: annotated with javax.xml.bind.annotation.*). \r\n\r\nTo add a new vertical, begin by creating a class which extends GenericCRUDResource. This will need to be specialized around your Model and Entry classes. Your constructor will require a Service typed on your Model class, so go ahead and create one, extending GenericPermissionCheckingService. This will require you to implement a number of permission related abstract methods, as well as a Manager typed on your model. Once again create one, extending GenericCacheHoldingManager using your AO Entity as the second type parameter. The only abstract method is for error generation, though there are protected methods which you can override from GenericCacheHoldingManager to use as hooks for handling relational mappings. Your manager's constructor will require an ActiveObjectsDao and an AOMapper. In the simplest case, extend GenericActiveObjectsDao in the former case, and implement AOMapper in the latter. Your Dao should require nothing beyond being typed on your AO. Your AOMapper will require you to implement 3 methods relating your model to your AO Entity. Once this is done, you will need to register your Dao, AOMapper, Manager and Service with spring to make the constructor injectable (easiest with atlassian-plugin.xml <component> tags, though you can manage your own spring.xml if you swing that way). Finally, you will need to create an atlassian-plugin.xml <rest> entry for your Resource. You can now spin up your plugin and test your REST resource out through the developer toolbox (underneath the user-dropdown). \r\n\r\nWatch the repository for any future updates.\r\n", license_id: 3, use_id: 1, checked_at: "2014-03-11", result: true, notes: "Licenza\r\nhttps://bitbucket.org/jhatherly/pocketknife/src/f3707900365fe4a6117f0d3c238e40701f254196/LICENSE?at=master\r\n\r\n", purchased: false, own: false, leave_out: false},
